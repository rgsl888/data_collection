              One morning as he was bringing the water, he saw a nightingale perched on one of the branches of the rose tree. The bird was hopping about and playfully pulling one of the most beautiful roses to pieces. The angry man drove the bird away; but when he came the next morning, he found that the nightingale had returned, and that the ground beneath the rose tree was covered with torn petals. This time the man was so angry that he laid a snare to catch the bird. The third morning, when he came out into his garden, the roses were unharmed, for the nightingale was caught fast in the snare. The man hurried to fetch a cage, and carried the captive home.

              The nightingale was very sad as she beat about the cage, and finally besought the man to tell her why it was that he had imprisoned her. ""Was it to hear my song?"" she asked. ""But it cannot be for that,"" she added, ""for do I not sing sweetly to you every evening from my nest in the garden?""

              Fascinated, Daniel followed his grandmother's old fingers while they deftly wove magic in their mathematical dance. Wrinkled folds of skin, draped almost casually over her old bones, moved in ways that mocked his young, but clumsy, fingers. Every motion was elegant choreography, each fold an artful rendition of an exact science. Two days of insistence had finally convinced her to share her secrets. This was the initiation. Her price was his rapt attention.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              Displays of her handiwork were everywhere. A veritable menagerie of birds, fish, flowers, and even entire scenes spread throughout the house. One shelf displayed a barnyard diorama complete with pigs, horses, chickens, and a farmer watching over them all. On another shelf, she had gathered a full orchestra. Before the assembled musicians, the black-clad conductor stood on a podium, his baton held high. Other objects were strictly decorative: strange boxes and shapes of various colors. She, herself, wore a pair of earrings from which dangled two identical deep-purple birds.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              This week of forced confinement with his grandmother was turning out to be interesting after all. Daniel could almost forgive his parents for abandoning him while they took a holiday on their own.

              The paper opened briefly and collapsed again under her fingers as she worked the crease to a point that had not existed before. ""That's called a petal fold,"" she said. 'This point could just as easily be one of the bird's wings as its head and tail. In a more difficult design, it could become the head and tail of a dinosaur.""
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              A smile of wonder crossed Daniel's lips. ""Yeah!"" he breathed. The lumbering crash of a great beast sounded in his imagination, the mental camera panning up and down to catch the terrible gaze of the prehistoric monster. Heart-pounding background music accompanied its earsplitting roar.

As a public figure, she felt a responsibility to set an example.

She performed in many prestigious locations, including Constitution Hall, where she sang after the DAR changed its policies. By 1954, segregation was declared unconstitutional. The Civil Rights Act was signed into law in 1964, the year Marian retired from performing. By then, many of the barriers she'd had to fight through were disappearing.

His family was prosperous, and White was raised with the mix of sophistication and common sense that would mark his writing.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">After graduation from Cornell University, White spent a year as a newspaper reporter in New York City, then decided to drive across the country with a friend in a Model T Ford. The trip gave White a lifetime of anecdotes, and spawned a legend or two. ""When they ran out of money,"" White 's friend, James Thurber, noted, ""they played for their supper—and their gasoline—on a fascinating musical instrument that White had made out of some pieces of wire and an old shoe.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">When White returned to New York City in the mid-I920s, he spent a few years bouncing between advertising jobs and unemployment before trying his hand again at writing. Borrowing his brother's typewriter, he began pounding out sketches and poems. On a lark, he sent some essays to a fledgling magazine called <span class=""stressed_text_2"">The New Yorker</span>. Since its founding in 1925, the magazine had struggled to find its niche, and White's work helped put <span class=""stressed_text_2"">The New Yorker</span> on the map. His essays were funny and sophisticated; they spoke equally to socialites and cab drivers, professors and plumbers. Through his essays, which he wrote for nearly 50 years, White helped give <span class=""stressed_text_2"">The New Yorker</span> its voice and identity.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">In 1945, already a leading literary figure, White embarked on his second career: writing children's books. He moved from New York to a farm in Maine, where he raised chickens and geese. Seeking a way to amuse his nieces and nephews, White started to write stories for them. ""Children were always after me to tell them a story and I found I couldn't do it,"" he said. ""So I had to get it down on paper.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">A vivid dream about a mouselike character led to <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Stuart Little</span>. Then, in 1952, White published <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Charlotte's Web</span>.

We encountered better luck than we had bargained for.</span> The cow moose and her young one were standing near the wall of the deer park below the monkey house, and in order to get a better view we strolled down to the lower end of the park, by the brook. The path there is not much traveled. As we approached the corner where the brook trickles under the wire fence, we noticed a red deer getting to her feet. Beside her, on legs that were just learning their business, was a spotted fawn, as small and perfect as a trinket seen through a reducing glass. They stood there, mother and child, under a gray beech whose trunk was engraved with dozens of hearts and initials. Stretched on the ground was another fawn, and we realized that the doe had just finished twinning. The second fawn was still wet, still unrisen. Here was a scene of rare sylvan splendor, in one of our five favorite boroughs, and we couldn't have asked for more.

From the monkey house came the loud, insane hooting of some captious primate, filling the whole woodland with a wild hooroar. As we watched, the sun broke weakly through, brightened the rich red of the fawns, and kindled their white spots.

Meanwhile the first fawn tiptoed toward the shallow brook, in little stops and goes, and started across. He paused midstream to make a slight contribution, as a child does in bathing. Then, while his mother watched, he continued across, gained the other side, selected a hiding place, and lay down under a skunk-cabbage leaf next to the fence, in perfect concealment, his legs folded neatly under him.

We encountered better luck than we had bargained for.</span> The cow moose and her young one were standing near the wall of the deer park below the monkey house, and in order to get a better view we strolled down to the lower end of the park, by the brook. The path there is not much traveled. As we approached the corner where the brook trickles under the wire fence, we noticed a red deer getting to her feet. Beside her, on legs that were just learning their business, was a spotted fawn, as small and perfect as a trinket seen through a reducing glass. They stood there, mother and child, under a gray beech whose trunk was engraved with dozens of hearts and initials. Stretched on the ground was another fawn, and we realized that the doe had just finished twinning. The second fawn was still wet, still unrisen.

From the monkey house came the loud, insane hooting of some captious primate, filling the whole woodland with a wild hooroar. As we watched, the sun broke weakly through, brightened the rich red of the fawns, and kindled their white spots.

Meanwhile the first fawn tiptoed toward the shallow brook, in little stops and goes, and started across. He paused midstream to make a slight contribution, as a child does in bathing. Then, while his mother watched, he continued across, gained the other side, selected a hiding place, and lay down under a skunk-cabbage leaf next to the fence, in perfect concealment, his legs folded neatly under him.

""Just what I need to make a nice turkey stuffing,"" Ma had said when Willy arrived home with them a few days back. He was glad she hadn't asked where he'd found the chestnuts. It was a story he wasn't anxious to tell...</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">Willy had taken a shortcut through the forest, hoping to practice some tracking skills. Be sure to mark your trail, Pa always said, so he'd been slicing curls of bark from tree trunks. The fresh blazes glowed white in the gloom of the forest. No fear of missing those on the way back, Willy thought, folding down the blade of his jackknife. </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">He had just started to search the ground for animal tracks when a squirrel bounded across his path. For a frozen moment it stared up at him, and Willy noticed its bulging cheeks. ""I'll bet you've got a cache of nuts somewhere, you little rascal."" </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">The squirrel darted away, and Willy ran after it. Deeper and deeper he plunged into the forest, his eyes on the flicker of tail before him. Then, with a sudden leap, the squirrel scampered up a tree and vanished. Willy collapsed against the tree trunk, panting. Lost him! </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">Peering around, he felt the darkness of the forest press down on him. No white blazes pointed the way back. With a stab of alarm he realized he'd completely forgotten Pa's warning. What will I do? Willy slumped onto a large gnarled root. Shout? No use. Too far from home.Perhaps someone will come along. He listened hard. Nothing but eerie silence. Don't panic, he told himself. Don't panic. But he'd heard about people being lost in the woods for days, sometimes even...forever. </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">A rustle of leaves made him glance around. The squirrel! They stared at each other, unblinking, for a second. Then, with a flip of its tail, the squirrel disappeared under a twisted root. </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""I'll bet that's your hiding place."" Willy was about to thrust his hand into the hole when he thought about the squirrel's sharp teeth. Instead he picked up a short stick. No angry scolding followed his probing, so he reached in. It was a cache of beechnuts. He could feel their three-sided shapes. And what was that? Something bigger. He drew out a handful. There, among the small, shiny beechnuts was one big chestnut. If there's one, there must be more. He felt around again. Yes, more big ones. Just what Ma needs for the turkey stuffing. Then he remembered— home. How was he going to find his way home? </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">There must be a way out. He peered into the darkness, hoping for any sign of the way he had come. Nothing. No—wait. A memory tugged at the back of his mind—just before the squirrel disappeared, his hand had brushed against smooth bark. Most of these trees had rough bark. But what if... Searching carefully, Willy spotted a smooth-barked tree. Underneath it on the forest floor were scuffled leaves. And there! Leading away was a line of scuffs. Leaves crunched by feet. Were these his own footprints? Yes! He could follow them back to the path. </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""Hooray!"" Willy shouted. Then he remembered the nuts. I'll come back for them. But, no, on second thought he didn't really want to come here again. </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">He pulled off his shirt, shivering in the chilly October air. It would make a good carrying sack. He'd run to keep himself warm. </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">He'd cleared the squirrel's hole right down to the bottom and was tying the shirt sleeves together to close the sack when a thought struck him.

Gates (1955- ) was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. His interest in computers, which began at the age of thirteen, led Gates to realize the potential of a standard operating platform for the computer era, and through the success of his company Microsoft, he became one of the world's richest men. Criticized for its monopolistic practices, Microsoft was sued by the United States government in the 1990's. In 2000, Gates established the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has become the world's largest philanthropy dedicated to improving health and education worldwide. The following essay was published in 1999.</div></div><div class=""prose1""><div class=""paragraph"">Human beings are not the biggest animals. We're not the strongest or fastest. We're not the sharpest in sight or smell It's amazing how we survived against the many fierce creatures of nature. We survived and prospered because of our brains. We evolved to fill the cognitive niche. We learned how to use tools, to build shelter, to invent agriculture, to domesticate livestock, to develop civilization and culture, to cure and prevent disease. Our tools and technologies have helped us to shape the environment around us.</div><div class=""paragraph"">I'm an optimist. I believe in progress. I'd much rather be alive today than at any time in history—and not just because in an earlier age my skill set wouldn't have been as valuable and I'd have been a prime candidate for some beast's dinner. The tools of the Industrial Age extended the capabilities of our muscles. The tools of the digital age extend the capabilities of our minds.

If we sit back and wait for the digital age to come to us on terms defined by others, we won't be able to do either. The Web lifestyle can increase citizen involvement in government.

Gates (1955- ) was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. His interest in computers, which began at the age of thirteen, led Gates to realize the potential of a standard operating platform for the computer era, and through the success of his company Microsoft, he became one of the world's richest men. Criticized for its monopolistic practices, Microsoft was sued by the United States government in the 1990's. In 2000, Gates established the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has become the world's largest philanthropy dedicated to improving health and education worldwide. The following essay was published in 1999.</div></div><div class=""prose1""><div class=""paragraph"">Human beings are not the biggest animals. We're not the strongest or fastest. We're not the sharpest in sight or smell It's amazing how we survived against the many fierce creatures of nature. We survived and prospered because of our brains. We evolved to fill the cognitive niche. We learned how to use tools, to build shelter, to invent agriculture, to domesticate livestock, to develop civilization and culture, to cure and prevent disease. Our tools and technologies have helped us to shape the environment around us.</div><div class=""paragraph"">I'm an optimist. I believe in progress. I'd much rather be alive today than at any time in history—and not just because in an earlier age my skill set wouldn't have been as valuable and I'd have been a prime candidate for some beast's dinner. The tools of the Industrial Age extended the capabilities of our muscles. The tools of the digital age extend the capabilities of our minds. I'm even happier for my children, who will come of age in this new world.</div></div><div class=""prose1""><div class=""paragraph"">Page 1</div></div><div class=""prose1""><div class=""paragraph"">By embracing the digital age, we can accelerate the positive effects and mitigate the challenges, such as privacy and have-vs.-have-not. If we sit back and wait for the digital age to come to us on terms defined by others, we won't be able to do either. The Web lifestyle can increase citizen involvement in government.

The rows of apartment buildings and the streets full of cars looked all the same. And it was cold.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Rosa missed her country. She had begun to learn some English, but she did not know what to say or what to do when other kids were around. They were friendly, but Rosa felt safer being alone.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Behind Rosa's brick apartment building was a special place, a small creek where Rosa always stopped after school. There were ducks there, and she could speak to them in her language. The ducks seemed to understand.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Every afternoon Rosa sat on a concrete slab above the creek and watched the ducks until Mama came home from work.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Rosa did not feed them. She knew that most people food was not right for ducks. But she watched them swim and feed and walk up to her, quacking. Once they even walked over Rosa's tummy as she lay with her feet stretched out on the bumpy grass. They like me, Rosa said to herself.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">One day after school, the ducks were not in the water. They did not waddle toward Rosa, even though she stayed very still. Something was wrong.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Gently, Rosa tiptoed to where the ducks were huddled. ""Are you sick?"" she whispered. They looked different. They looked greasy.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Then Rosa noticed the creek. An oily film covered it, making patches of color on the water's surface. She looked closely at the ducks. Their feathers were stuck together. They could not swim. They could not fly.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">I must get help, said Rosa to herself. But how? I don't know anyone. Mama told me not to speak to strangers. Besides, I don't know how to ask in English.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Rosa had an idea. She rushed back to the street, walked to the traffic light, then raced around the corner and back to the school yard.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Rosa was in luck. Boys and girls were still there practicing baseball with the gym teacher. Rosa had never played baseball in this country.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">""Please! Come!"" said Rosa, breathless, ""Ducks!""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">""Hello, Rosa,"" said the teacher. ""What's the trouble?""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">""Ducks!"" said Rosa again. It was one of the few English words she was sure of. ""Come. Please. Ducks!""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">She pointed in the direction of the creek. The kids were staring at her, but she didn't care. ""Ducks!"" she said again, her dark eyes pleading.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">The teacher said something in English to his team. They looked as Rosa and talked all at once. Then the teacher smiled. ""OK, Rosa,"" he said. ""Show us."" They all grabbed their baseball mitts and bats, and followed Rosa to the creek.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Pretty soon there were more people at Rosa's creek than she had ever seen there before. First the police came with their squad cars and sirens. Then came the firefighters with their big trucks and Humane Society workers in their vans.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">People came out from the apartment building with dishpans and towels and liquid dish detergent. Rosa did not understand all the talk, but she knew what was happening.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">The ducks were too weak to fly or run away. She and the other kids rounded them up and held them in the dishpans while the Humane Society people worked. Four washes for each duck with mild detergent, and four rinses with clear water. It reminded Rosa of doing the wash.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">After a while someone brought a blow-dryer. Rosa laughed as the ducks were blown fluffy-dry. One by one, they were packed carefully into cages in the Humane Society vans.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">""We'll keep them for a few days,"" one of the workers said. ""They need time to regain the natural oils in their feathers, so they can keep themselves warm and swim properly. A big factory upstream spilled four hundred gallons of diesel fuel into the storm sewers last night. What a mess! You got to these ducks just in time, young lady.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Rosa did not know what the man was saying, but she saw how everyone smiled at her, and she felt proud.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">By the time Rosa's mama came home, the cars and the vans and the people were gone. Rosa was in her special place by the creek. But she was not alone. She was playing baseball with three friends. Rosa was good at baseball. She was getting better at English, too.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">""Home run!"" she shouted, laughing, after she slugged the ball almost to the parking lot. Rosa was happy. And the dishpan ducks were safe.</div><div class=""attrib"">Copyright © 1990 by Highlights</div><div class=""attrib"">for Children, Inc.

That was in the fall of 1997. Ellie was 11 years old at the time, and she was getting her tresses trimmed in her hometown of Berkeley, California. When Ellie and her mom returned to their car, they found a parking ticket stuck to the windshield. It didn't seem possible: Less than an hour earlier, Ellie had pumped an hour's worth of coins into the meter. But now the needle was at zero, and Ellie's mom owed $20.</div><div class=""paragraph"">Feeling cheated, Ellie dropped another nickel in the meter and twisted the knob. The needle clicked over to the four-minute mark. Ellie stared at her watch while her mom watched the meter. Less than three minutes later, all of the time had expired. There it was: proof that they'd been cheated. The city tore up the ticket when Ellie's mom complained about the meter.</div><div class=""paragraph"">But the experience left Ellie wondering how many other meters were inaccurate. Six months later, she decided to find out. She'd been looking around for a good science-fair project—and that meter in Berkeley still bothered her. So armed with a bag of nickels and a stopwatch, she hit the streets.</div><div class=""paragraph"">Ellie didn't have the time or money to test every meter, so she focused on a sample of 50 meters located in different parts of the city. To avoid inconveniencing motorists, she did her research after 6 P.M. and on Sundays, when the meters were not in use. She put in eight minutes' worth of nickels in each meter, then measured how much time it really gave.</div><div class=""paragraph"">The results were not pretty. Ellie's findings suggested that more than nine out of every ten meters in the city were inaccurate—and that every fourth parking meter was running out of time too quickly. With 3,600 parking meters in the city, that meant a lot of undeserved tickets. As Ellie wrote in her science-project report, ""I learned which meters cheat you and which meters cheat the City of Berkeley. But I learned that almost all meters cheat someone, so beware.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">When the science fair rolled around, Ellie presented her findings with computer-generated charts and graphs. Her classmates weren't very interested in her project. ""It's not like they have to drive a car or put money in a parking meter,"" she explains. But her project was a huge hit with parents. More than 50 of them lined up that night to share their own parking-meter horror stories with Ellie.</div><div class=""paragraph"">After that, word about Ellie's meter project spread fast. Within a few weeks, Ellie got a call from local politician Diane Woolley. At the time, Berkeley was considering replacing its meters with more accurate digital ones. Ellie shared her findings at city hall, and the politicians were impressed. ""We don't get reports this thorough when we pay consultants hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" one remarked. Based on Ellie's study, they decided to purchase 2,000 new meters.</div><div class=""paragraph"">The California state legislature also decided to crack down on cheater meters. After Ellie presented her findings, they enacted ""Lammer's Law,"" which requires California's 26 counties to test the accuracy of parking meters. Any meter found to be inaccurate must be fixed or dismantled.</div><div class=""paragraph"">California Governor Pete Wilson signed the law on November 1, 1998. At the time, he commented, ""Ellie's ingenuity and dedication has earned her the gratitude of those Californians who've dug through their purses and pockets in search of exact change to feed the meters, only to return to find their cars bearing the dreaded green envelope of a parking ticket.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">Ellie became a celebrity. She was in newspapers all over the country and featured on local television news during the summer and fall of 1998. CNN did a story about her. She was even a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman. ""It was kind of a weird moment of being a celebrity,"" she says.</div><div class=""paragraph"">Ellie, who's now an eighth-grader at Martin Luther King Middle School, is proud of the work she's done. But she doesn't see meter monitoring as her life's work: ""Right now I don't mind being known as the parking-meter girl, but I'm sure that later in life I'll want something different.""</div><div class=""attrib"">© 2000 by Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

Once upon a time, years and years ago, they had ordinary plain brown coats. This is how it happened that the Brazilian beetle earned a new coat.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">One day a little brown beetle was crawling along a wall when a big gray rat ran out of a hole in the wall and looked down scornfully at the little beetle.""O ho!""he said to the beetle,""how slowly you crawl along.

Just look at me and see how fast I can run.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">The big gray rat ran to the end of the wall, wheeled around, and came back to the place where the little beetle was slowly crawling along at only a tiny distance from where the rat had left her.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""Don't you wish that you could run like that?""said the big gray rat to the little brown beetle.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""You are surely a fast runner,""replied the little brown beetle politely. Her mother had taught her always to be polite and had often said to her that a really polite beetle never boasts about her own accomplishments. The little brown beetle never boasted a single boast about the things she could do. She just went on slowly crawling along the wall.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">A bright green and gold parrot in the mango tree over the wall had heard the conversation.""How would you like to race with the beetle?""he asked the big gray rat.""I live next door to the tailor bird,""he added,""and just to make the race exciting I'll offer a brightly colored coat as a prize to the one who wins the race. You may choose for it any color you like and I'll have it made to order.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""I'd like a yellow coat with stripes like the tiger's,""said the big gray rat, looking over his shoulder at his gaunt gray sides as if he were already admiring his new coat.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""I'd like a beautiful, brightly colored new coat, too,""said the little brown beetle.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">The big gray rat laughed long and loud until his gaunt gray sides were shaking.""Why, you talk just as if you thought you had a chance to win the race,""he said, when he could speak.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">The bright green and gold parrot set the royal palm tree at the top of the cliff as the goal of the race. He gave the signal to start and then he flew away to the royal palm tree to watch for the end of the race.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">The big gray rat ran as fast as he could. Then he thought how very tired he was getting.""What's the use of hurrying?""he said to himself.""The little brown beetle cannot possibly win. If I were racing with somebody who could really run it would be very different.""Then he started to run more slowly, but every time his heart beat it said,""Hurry up! Hurry up!""The big gray rat decided that it was best to obey the little voice in his heart so he hurried just as fast as he could.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">When he reached the royal palm tree at the top of the cliff he could hardly believe his eyes. He thought he must be having a bad dream. There was the little brown beetle sitting quietly beside the bright green and gold parrot.

Once upon a time, years and years ago, they had ordinary plain brown coats. This is how it happened that the Brazilian beetle earned a new coat.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">One day a little brown beetle was crawling along a wall when a big gray rat ran out of a hole in the wall and looked down scornfully at the little beetle.""O ho!""he said to the beetle,""how slowly you crawl along. You'll never get anywhere in the world. Just look at me and see how fast I can run.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">The big gray rat ran to the end of the wall, wheeled around, and came back to the place where the little beetle was slowly crawling along at only a tiny distance from where the rat had left her.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""Don't you wish that you could run like that?""said the big gray rat to the little brown beetle.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""You are surely a fast runner,""replied the little brown beetle politely. Her mother had taught her always to be polite and had often said to her that a really polite beetle never boasts about her own accomplishments. The little brown beetle never boasted a single boast about the things she could do. She just went on slowly crawling along the wall.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">A bright green and gold parrot in the mango tree over the wall had heard the conversation.""How would you like to race with the beetle?""he asked the big gray rat.""I live next door to the tailor bird,""he added,""and just to make the race exciting I'll offer a brightly colored coat as a prize to the one who wins the race. You may choose for it any color you like and I'll have it made to order.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""I'd like a yellow coat with stripes like the tiger's,""said the big gray rat, looking over his shoulder at his gaunt gray sides as if he were already admiring his new coat.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""I'd like a beautiful, brightly colored new coat, too,""said the little brown beetle.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">The big gray rat laughed long and loud until his gaunt gray sides were shaking.""Why, you talk just as if you thought you had a chance to win the race,""he said, when he could speak.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">The bright green and gold parrot set the royal palm tree at the top of the cliff as the goal of the race. He gave the signal to start and then he flew away to the royal palm tree to watch for the end of the race.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">The big gray rat ran as fast as he could. Then he thought how very tired he was getting.""What's the use of hurrying?""he said to himself.""The little brown beetle cannot possibly win. If I were racing with somebody who could really run it would be very different.""Then he started to run more slowly, but every time his heart beat it said,""Hurry up! Hurry up!""The big gray rat decided that it was best to obey the little voice in his heart so he hurried just as fast as he could.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">When he reached the royal palm tree at the top of the cliff he could hardly believe his eyes. He thought he must be having a bad dream. There was the little brown beetle sitting quietly beside the bright green and gold parrot. The big gray rat had never been so surprised in all his life.""How did you ever manage to run fast enough to get here so soon?""he asked the little brown beetle as soon as he could catch his breath.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">The little brown beetle drew out the tiny wings from her sides.""Nobody said anything about having to run to win the race,""she replied,""so I flew instead.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""I did not know that you could fly,""said the big gray rat in a subdued little voice.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">""After this,""said the bright green and gold parrot,""never judge anyone by his looks alone. You never can tell how often or where you may find concealed wings. You have lost the prize.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">Then the parrot turned to the little brown beetle who was waiting quietly at his side.""What color do you want your new coat to be?""he asked.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">The little brown beetle looked up at the bright green and gold parrot, at the green and gold palm trees above their heads, at the green mangoes with golden flushes on their cheeks lying on the ground under the mango trees, at the golden sunshine upon the distant green hills.""I choose a coat of green and gold,""she said.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">From that day to this the Brazilian beetle has worn a coat of green with golden lights upon it.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px;"">And until this day, even in Brazil, where the flowers and birds and beasts and insects have such gorgeous coloring, the rat wears a dull gray coat.</div></div><br>79. <div class=""paragraph"">The beetle chooses green and gold for the colors of her coat because they are</div></br></div><div class=""distractors""><div>A. <span class=""itemtext""><span>unusual colors</span></span></div>

Named after Samuel Ellis, the 27-acre knot of an island barely stuck out of the water at high tide.</img></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Ellis Island became important to millions of immigrants in 1892, however, when the U.S. government converted it to an immigration station. Between 1892 and 1954, the island became—for more than 17 million souls—the doorway to America .</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">As you will see in their own words below, America offered immigrants more than just opportunity. You also will see that the ""the land of the free"" was not so free to everyone, after all.</div><div> </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Escaping to America</span></div><div> </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">The closing years of the 19th century were an oppressive time in many eastern and southern European nations. In such countries as Russia, Poland, and Armenia , millions of families were suffering. Wars, famines, and pogroms (organized massacres of Jews and other minorities) caused millions of people to flee.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Ida Mouradjian fled to America from Armenia to escape annihilation by the Turkish government:</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">They [the Turks] would displace every Armenian out of their own homes, out of their own towns and drive them into the Syrian Desert. The idea was to get every Armenian there and by the time they got there they would either die of hunger or exposure or pestilence.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">But not all were running from the horrors of violence or poverty. Some, like Theodore Lubik from the Ukraine, wanted to avoid the military draft and simply saw the U.S. as a great opportunity:</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">A friend of mine, he had gone to America . He came to Europe once on a visit...He looked just like a governor—horses, wagon, dressed fine, giving his pocket change to us. He gave me ten cents or a quarter—that was big money.</div><div> </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Hard Time Traveling</span></div><div> </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">In these times of turmoil, one could not easily move to the U.S. The trials of getting to Ellis Island were often life-threatening in themselves.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Along the way, many immigrants had to contend with border guards, thieves, and crooked immigration agents. But it was the trip across the Atlantic that immigrants tended to remember most.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Crammed into poorly ventilated sleeping areas or cabins below deck, immigrants—many of whom had never seen the sea before—often suffered rough crossings. Vera Gauditsa, pregnant during her crossing from Czechoslovakia , remembered the torture of seasickness:</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">I was pretty tough, but on the boat I was very sick. I thought the child wanted to be born right then.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">I had a cabin, but in the cabin was nothing. You had to go through the whole boat to get to the showers and a toilet. So imagine when you are sick and you have to go to the bathroom and walk!</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">But upon seeing their destination, most immigrants—like Sarah Asher from Russia —forgot about sickness and thought only of a bright future:</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">About four or five o'clock in the morning we all got up. The sunshine started and what do we see? The Statue of Liberty !</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_2"">Well, she was beautiful with the early-morning light. Everybody was crying. Beautiful colors, the greenish-like water</span> — <span class=""stressed_text_2"">and so big. We could see New York already, with the big buildings and everything</span> . . . <span class=""stressed_text_2"">There was a house where the boat stopped but only the Americans were able to go out, but we foreigners remained. Our boat moved further, and that was when we realized we were going to Ellis Island.</span></div><div> </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Stuck at the Door</span></div><div> </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Having to wait while first- and second-class passengers got off the boat, many immigrants began to realize that their troubles were not over.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">After docking at Manhattan Island, immigrants in steerage were shipped by barge to Ellis Island, to go through examinations. On the island, the immigrants were guided into holding pens in the Great Hall. Irene Zambelli, from Greece , recalled the routine:</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_2"">There were little gates, the same as you go [through] to the subways</span> . . . <span class=""stressed_text_2"">The first gate we [Irene and her cousin] passed they asked what we were to one another. Then we came to the next gate and they asked us how much was two and two, and four and four. We answered and went to the next gate.</span></div><div> </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Cutting Back the Flow</span></div><div> </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">The number of immigrants increased over the years, peaking at 1,285,349 in 1907. U.S. officials grew concerned. They saw the growing numbers as a threat to American workers. The officials were afraid the foreigners would take away wages and jobs. As a result, the entrance examinations were made tougher. They included a medical exam and a literacy test. An immigrant who failed one of these tests faced <span class=""stressed_text_1"">deportation</span> (being sent back) to his or her native country.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Of all the examinations, the medical exam seemed to cause immigrants the most concern, recalled Catherine Bolinski, who came from Poland :</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_2"">They turned your eye[lid] over</span> — <span class=""stressed_text_2"">I had to blink a couple of times that way. I'll never forget it. They looked at your throat and to see if you had any rashes on your body. They found things wrong with some people. They sent them back, after they [had] sold everything to come here, so they were crying, they felt very bad.</span></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">The thought of being deported was terrifying. Fannie Kligerman, who escaped from Russia with her family, remembered the fear:</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">One of my brothers had something wrong with him. It was a sty. It left a funny thing and they put him aside. And they told us that if there was anything wrong with him, he'd have to go back to Europe. Oh, it was frightening. My father said, ""I'm not going on without the children. We will all go back.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><div> </div><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Charting America's Course</span></div><div> </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Only three percent of those who arrived at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954 were turned away. By 1924, however, the government changed its policy. It slammed shut the ""open door"" that had allowed so many millions to flock to the U.S. The Immigration Act of 1924 set a quota of 164,000 immigrants per year. By 1954, Ellis Island had been shut down.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">But for those who had passed through, America was truly a land of opportunity—despite often-severe hardships. Settling throughout the U.S., immigrants such as composer Irving Berlin, football coach Knute Rockne, and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter added to America 's strength.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Having escaped from Russia, Arnold Weiss voiced the determination and hope of the immigrants who passed through Ellis Island:</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_2"">From the whole story of what I went through in all my years</span> — <span class=""stressed_text_2"">and some of it wasn't very pleasant</span>— <span class=""stressed_text_2"">I still love this country.

She loved pioneer stories about America's West, and felt she had been born too late.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">But then she read about rocket inventor Robert Goddard. She realized that she had not been born too late to be a space explorer!</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">And explore space she did. On September 26, 1996, after a month's delay, Dr. Lucid returned to Earth after spending more than six months on the Russian space station <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Mir</span>.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">Dr. Lucid was the second American astronaut to live aboard <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Mir</span> as part of a program to study how long-term travel in space affects the human body. The results will help the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) develop an international space station.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">Dr. Lucid loved life in orbit. She said: ""One of the best things to do is to look out the window and see the Earth, and watch the seasons change. I got to see the ice in all the lakes break up, and the Earth bloom.""</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">Now she holds the American and women's record for the longest stay in space, and she received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor from President Clinton.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Adventurous Spirit</span></div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">It's possible that Dr. Lucid became an adventurous spirit when she was a baby. Her parents took her along as they traveled throughout China during and after World War II. The family settled in the United States when Shannon was six, but the future astronaut was always looking forward to the adventure of another move.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">She pursued her love of science and her dream of space travel. As a result, she earned a pilot's license and degrees in chemistry and biochemistry.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">But she was disappointed when NASA accepted only men to its first space program in 1959 and 1960. When NASA finally admitted women in 1978, Dr. Lucid was one of the first six women to be accepted. And she was a crew member on several successful space shuttle missions.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Aboard <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Mir</span></span></div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">On the Russian space station, Dr. Lucid's determination helped her cope with the stress of weightlessness, a small living space, and a diet of dehydrated foods.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">She also learned from the first American to live aboard <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Mir</span>, Dr. Norman Thagard. Dr. Thagard had lost seventeen pounds while eating unfamiliar Russian food, and he had been lonely.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">Dr. Lucid was determined to stay healthy and happy. She took some American foods, such as shrimp, tomatoes, potato chips, and candy. Supply ships delivered her favorite snacks as well as fresh fruits and vegetables.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">And she stayed in touch with her family. Messages and books came from home. She wrote to her family through daily E-mail and talked to them in frequent ""visits"" by radio and television.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">To stay fit in space, Dr. Lucid spent hundreds of hours exercising on a treadmill and stationary bicycle. Although she was in space longer than any other American, she maintained her weight. Also, she lost only a little strength in her bones and muscles.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">When she returned to Earth, she surprised everyone because she was still strong enough to walk off the space shuttle instead of being carried.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">While on <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Mir</span>, Dr. Lucid also did research. In experiments on the development of quail eggs and growing wheat, she studied the effects of weightlessness on living things. In fact, her own body was an experiment in human adaptation to space. Dr. Lucid also studied ocean currents and photographed Earth.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">She enjoyed life on <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Mir</span> but missed bookstores, gooey desserts, the sun, the wind, and in-line skating with her daughters. ""You really were isolated,"" she said. ""You just couldn't run out and buy some fresh fruit.""</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Two Yuris</span></div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">Dr. Lucid's companions for most of her stay were two men, Russian cosmonauts named Yuri Usachov and Yuri Onufriyenko.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">Dr. Lucid's mission was successful partly because she had a good relationship with the cosmonauts. She joked, ate, and watched adventure movies with ""Yuri and Yuri,"" as she calls them.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">Even though she and the two cosmonauts grew up when the United States and Russia were enemies, they became friends aboard <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Mir</span>.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">  ""It dawned on all three of us at once how remarkable it was that we were three people who grew up in totally different parts of the world, mortally afraid of each other,"" she said. ""And here we were in an outpost in space, enjoying living together.""</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">Dr. Shannon Lucid can inspire anyone who thinks that dreams come true only in fairy tales. ""Who would have ever thought that I would have spent time on a Russian space station?"" she said.

""Jason, Jason, I'm six years old!"" she cried, jumping up and down.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">""I know, I know."" Jason gave her a big hug.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Soon the house was buzzing with excitement. Megan sat on the stool watching while Mom and Aunt Nancy prepared the birthday dinner. Dad wouldn't be back for at least two hours. Jason wandered outside trying to think of something to do, but his thoughts kept returning to the box in the barn.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">He started walking toward the barn, not at all sure what he'd do when he got there. He was hoping for just a glimpse of the box. Instead he heard a strange noise coming from inside the barn. He wished he could just turn back to the house, but his legs carried him into the barn. Jason saw the box. It was sitting between two bales of hay. He could hear loud wailing cries. Leaning over, Jason carefully lifted the lid. There was the most cuddly puppy he had ever seen!</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">""You must be pretty scared, huh, fellow?"" Jason said quietly as he held the wiggly dog. ""Megan's going to love you!"" He secretly wished the puppy was for him. After all, Mom and Dad knew that he had been wanting his own puppy. Probably Aunt Nancy didn't know that, and anyway Megan would be happy.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Soon Jason was playing happily with the puppy, and he forgot that he wasn't supposed to be in the barn. Taffy, their big brown horse, stuck his head in the window as if to say, ""What's going on?"" Jason jumped, remembering that he wasn't supposed to be there. The puppy ran off as fast as it could out of the barn and into the field.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Jason stumbled out of the barn looking wildly for any trace of the puppy. ""Come on, puppy!

Mom called even louder now. Just when he was determined to stay forever in the tall weeds, he heard his sister's voice.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">""Jason!

It was Dad calling from the front yard.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Jason slowly got out of the chair.

He turned and saw that Mom, Aunt Nancy, and Megan were smiling, too. What would he say to them when there was nothing in the box?

The puppy looked up at him with sleepy eyes.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">""Wow!"" said Jason, bewildered.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">""The puppy's for you, Son,"" his father said.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">""I thought you'd like a gift, too, even if it isn't your birthday,"" said Aunt Nancy, laughing.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Megan started clapping.

Matarić, a Brandeis University computer scientist, believes robots will do their best work only when they begin to work together. ""How do you get a herd of robots to do something without killing each other?"" she asks. According to Matarić, you have to put them in societies and let them learn from one another, just as seagulls and baboons and people do. Matarić has already made an impressive start at teaching robots social skills. She has gotten 14 robots to cooperate at once—the biggest gaggle of machines ever to socialize.</div><div class=""paragraph"">  The Nerd Herd, as Matarić calls them, are shoe-box-size machines, each of which has four wheels, two tongs to grab things, and a two-way radio. The radio allows them to triangulate their position with respect to two fixed transmitters as they wander around Matarić's lab. It also allows them to broadcast their coordinates and other information to their neighbors. Infrared sensors help the robots find things and avoid obstacles; contact-sensitive strips tell them when they've crashed anyway.</div><div class=""paragraph"">  Each robot is programmed with a handful of what Matarić calls behaviors—sets of instructions that enable the robot to accomplish a small goal, like following the robot in front of it. Set one robot on the floor with its wheels turned permanently to the left and program the others to follow, and they will all drive in a circle until their batteries go dead. But Matarić can get more interesting actions out of the herd by programming them to alternate among several behaviors. By telling them to home in on a target, to aggregate when they're too far from one another, to disperse when they're too crowded and to avoid collisions at all times, she's been able to get scattered robots to come together and migrate across her lab like a flock of birds.</div><div class=""paragraph"">  More important, the robots can also learn on their own to carry out more complex tasks. One task Matarić set for them was to forage for little metal pucks and bring them home to their nest in a corner of the lab. To give the task a natural flavor, Matarić gave the robots clocks; at ""night""they had to go home and rest, and in the ""morning"" they looked for pucks again. In addition to five basic behaviors they could choose from, she endowed them with a sort of prime directive: to maximize their individual point scores. Each time a robot did something right, such as locating a puck, it was automatically rewarded with points; each time it committed a blooper, such as dropping a puck, it lost points.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div align=""center"" class=""paragraph""><div class=""stdaln_img""><img alt=""Drawing of the Sharebots robot"" class=""inln_img"" height=""293"" src=""./ReadMed_files/ItemResource(35)"" title=""Drawing of the Sharebots robot"" width=""273""/></div><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Matarić's Nerd Herd, with the pucks they now pursue collectively.</span></div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">  After some random experimentation, the robots soon learned how to forage but not very well, because they tended to interfere with one another in their selfish pursuit of points. ""Why should you ever stop and let someone else go?"" asks Matarić. ""It's always in your interest to go but if everybody feels that way, then nobody gets through and they jam up and fight for space.""To make her creatures more efficient, though, Matarić found she didn't have to program them with a God's-eye view of what was good for all robots. She just had to teach each robot to share to let other robots know when it had found a puck, and to listen to other robots in return. ""I put in the impetus to pay attention to what other robots are doing, and to try what other robots are trying, sharing the experience,"" Matarić explains. ""If I do some thing that's good and if I say, 'That was really great,' then you may try it.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">  With this simple social contract, the robots needed only 15 minutes of practice to become altruistic. They would magnanimously announce their discovery of pucks, despite having no way of knowing that this was good for the herd as a whole. At times when two robots lunged for a puck, they would stop and go through an ""After you!"" ""No, after you!"" routine, but eventually they figured out the proper way to yield. With social graces, the robot herd brought home the pucks twice as fast as without.</div><div class=""paragraph"">  Matarić thinks she'll be able to produce more complex robot societies. ""I'm looking at getting specialization in the society so they can say, 'I'll do this, and you do that.' If one of them has a low battery, it may become the messenger that doesn't actually carry things. And I imagine one robot might emerge as a leader because it happens to be the most efficient. But if it stops being efficient, some other robot will take over.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-align:center; font-size:8px""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Carl Zimmer © 1995 The Walt Disney Co.

We used a wire trap baited with scraps of fish and meat. Each time a crab entered the trap to eat, we pulled the doors closed. We cooked and ate the crabs we caught.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">Blue crabs are very strong. Their big claws can make a painful pinch.

Other kinds of arthropods are insects, spiders, and centipedes. Blue crabs belong to a particular arthropod group called <span class=""stressed_text_1"">crustaceans</span>. Crustaceans are abundant in the ocean, just as insects are on land.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">The blue crab's hard shell is a strong armor. But the armor must be cast off from time to time so the crab can grow bigger.

The story recounts the events of a single day and the difficult decision made by a fictional emperor in 5<sup>th</sup> century China.</div><div class=""paragraph"">While the Emperor is enjoying the tranquility of the morning, a servant rushes in to tell him about a ""miracle."" After several attempts, the servant finally rouses the Emperor to look at the miracle in the sky: a man flying with wings fashioned from paper and bamboo. The emperor is stunned, then demands that the inventor be brought to him.</div><div class=""paragraph"">The Emperor decrees that the man and his invention be destroyed because the progress symbolized by the flying machine threatens both the Emperor's way of life and the well-being of his people. In order to illustrate his point to the inventor, the Emperor shows an invention of his own that mirrors the natural world: a wind-up box containing small trees and miniature flying birds. The inventor tries to convince the Emperor that his flying machine, like the Emperor's invention, is a thing of beauty. The Emperor, however, chooses to protect the peace of his dominion from the possibility of future invasion, and sacrifices the momentary beauty provided by the flying machine. The story ends with the Emperor enjoying the peaceful miniature world inside his wind-up box.</div>________________________________________<div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">* We did not receive copyright approval to put the actual text from the student booklet on the Website.

Amanda Clement was sixteen years old. She sat quietly in the grandstand with her mother, but she imagined herself right out there on the baseball diamond with the players. Back home in Hudson, South Dakota, her brother Hank and his friends often asked her to umpire games. Sometimes she was even allowed to play first base.</div><div>     Today, Mandy, as she was called, could only sit and watch Hank pitch for Renville against Hawarden. The year was 1904, and girls were not supposed to participate in sports. But when the umpire for the preliminary game between two local teams didn't arrive, Hank asked Mandy to make the calls.</div><div>     Mrs. Clement didn't want her daughter to umpire a public event, but at last Hank and Mandy persuaded her to give her consent. Mandy eagerly took her position behind the pitcher's mound. Because only one umpire was used in those days, she had to call plays on the four bases as well as strikes and balls.</div><div>     Mandy was five feet ten inches tall and looked very impressive as she accurately called the plays. She did so well that the players for the big game asked her to umpire for them — with pay!</div><div>     Mrs. Clement was shocked at that idea. But Mandy finally persuaded her mother to allow her to do it. Amanda Clement became the first paid woman baseball umpire on record.</div><div>     Mandy's fame spread quickly. Before long, she was umpiring games in North and South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska. Flyers, sent out to announce upcoming games, called Mandy the ""World Champion Woman Umpire."" Her uniform was a long blue skirt, a black necktie, and a white blouse with UMPS stenciled across the front. Mandy kept her long dark hair tucked inside a peaked cap. She commanded respect and attention — players never said, ""Kill the umpire!"" They argued more politely, asking, ""Beg your pardon, Miss Umpire, but wasn't that one a bit high?""</div><div>     Mandy is recognized in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York; the Women's Sports Hall of Fame; and Women's Sports foundation in San Francisco, California. In 1912 she held the world record for a woman throwing a baseball: 279 feet.</div><div>     Mandy's earning for her work as an umpire came in especially handy. She put herself through college and became a teacher and coach, organizing teams and encouraging athletes wherever she lived. Mandy died in 1971. People who knew her remember her for her work as an umpire, teacher, and coach, and because she loved helping people as much as she loved sports.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""font-size:8pt;line-height:95%"">""Amanda Clement: The Umpire in a Skirt"", by Marilyn Kratz.

Brown</div><div class=""paragraph"">     A red sky at night does not usually cause wonder. But on the evening of April 26, 1777, the residents of Ludingtons' Mills were concerned. The crimson glow was in the east, not from the west where the sun was setting.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The Ludington family sat at supper, each one glancing now and again toward the eastern window. Sybil, at sixteen the oldest of eight children, could read the question in her mother's worried eyes. Would Henry Ludington have to go away again? As commander of the only colonial army regiment between Danbury, Connecticut, and Peekskill, New York, Sybil's father did not have much time to be with his family.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Thudding hooves in the yard abruptly ended their meal. The colonel pushed back his chair and strode to the door. Although Sybil followed him with her eyes, she dutifully began to help her sister Rebecca clear the table.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The girls were washing dishes when their father burst back into the room with a courier at his side.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Here, Seth,"" said the colonel, ""sit you down and have some supper. Rebecca, see to our weary friend.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Sybil, glancing over her shoulder, saw that the stranger was no older than she. A familiar flame of indignation burned her cheeks. Being a girl kept her from being a soldier!</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Across the room, her parents were talking together in low tones. Her father's voice rose.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Sybil, leave the dishes and come here,"" he said.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Obeying quickly, she overheard her father as he again spoke to her mother.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Abigail, she is a skilled rider. It is Sybil who has trained Star, and the horse will obey her like no other.""</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-align:center""><div class=""stdaln_img""><img alt=""Sybil Sounds the Alarm Image"" class=""inln_img"" height=""344"" src=""./ReadMed_files/ItemResource(41)"" title=""Sybil Sounds the Alarm Image"" width=""300""/></div></div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""That red glow in the sky,""Colonel Ludington said, turning now to his daughter, ""is from Danbury. It's been burned by British raiders. There are about two thousand Redcoats, and they're heading for Ridgefield. Someone must tell our men that the lull in the fighting is over; they will have to leave their families and crops again.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""I'll go! Star and I can do it!"" Sybil exclaimed. She faced her mother. ""Star is sure of foot, and will carry me safely.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""There are dangers other than slippery paths,"" her mother said, softly. ""Outlaws or deserters or Tories or even British soldiers may be met. You must be wary in a way that Star cannot.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     A lump rose in Sybil's throat. ""I can do it,"" she declared.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Without another word, Abigail Ludington turned to fetch a woolen cape to protect her daughter from the wind and rain. One of the boys was sent to saddle Star, and Sybil was soon ready. When she had swung up on her sturdy horse, the colonel placed a stick in her hand.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     As though reciting an oath, she repeated her father's directions: ""Go south by the river, then along Horse Pound Road to Mahopac Pond. From there, turn right to Red Mills, then go north to Stormville."" The colonel stood back and saluted. She was off!</div><div class=""paragraph"">     At the first few isolated houses, windows or doors flew open as she approached. She shouted her message and rode on. By the time she reached the first hamlet, all was dark. There were many small houses there at the edge of Shaw's Road, but everyone was in bed. Lights had not flared up at the sound of Star's hoofbeats. Sybil had not anticipated this. Biting her lower lip, she pulled Star to a halt. After considering for a moment, she nudged the horse forward, and riding up to one cottage after another, beat on each door with her stick.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Look at the sky!"" she shouted. ""Danbury's burning! All men muster at Ludingtons'!""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     At each village or cluster of houses, she repeated the cry. When lights began to shine and people were yelling and moving about, she would spur her horse onward. Before she and Star melted into the night, the village bells would be pealing out the alarm.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Paths were slippery with mud and wet stones, and the terrain was often hilly and wooded. Sybil's ears strained for sounds of other riders who might try to steal her horse or stop her mission. Twice she pulled Star off the path while unknown riders passed within a few feet. Both times, her fright dried her mouth and made her hands tremble.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     By the time they reached Stormville, Star had stumbled several times, and Sybil's voice was almost gone. The town's call to arms was sounding as they turned homeward. Covered with mud, tired beyond belief, Sybil could barely stay on Star's back when they rode into their yard. She had ridden more than thirty miles that night.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     In a daze, she saw the red sky in the east. It was the dawn. Several hundred men were milling about. She had roused them in time, and Ludington's regiment marched out to join the Connecticut militia in routing the British at Ridgefield, driving them back to their ships on Long Island Sound.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Afterward, General George Washington made a personal visit to Ludingtons' Mills to thank Sybil for her courageous deed. Statesman Alexander Hamilton wrote her a letter of praise.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Two centuries later visitors to the area of Patterson, New York, can still follow Sybil's route. A statue of Sybil on horseback stands at Lake Gleneida in Carmel, New York, and people in that area know well the heroism of Sybil Ludington. In 1978, a commemorative postage stamp was issued in her honor, bringing national attention to the heroic young girl who rode for independence.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""font-size:75%"">From <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Cobblestone's</span> September, 1983, issue: ""Patriotic Tales of the American Revolution.""

Anne was thirteen years old when she began keeping her diary on June 12, 1942. Two years later, in August 1944, the Nazis raided the Annex. Anne died seven or eight months later in a concentration camp. She was fifteen years old.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Anne's diary was first published in 1947. Since then it has been translated and published throughout the world. Through the publication of her diary, Anne has come to symbolize to the world the six million Jews killed by the Nazis.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Although Anne's diary is read throughout the world, her fiction is not as well known. In 1943–1944, Anne wrote a number of stories and began a novel, now published in <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Tales from the Secret Annex.</span> Anne states in her diary that she wanted to be a famous writer. Her fiction, like her diary, shows that she was indeed talented. The following excerpt is from her unfinished novel, <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Cady's Life.</span></div><div> </div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-align:center; font-size:140%;""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">CADY'S LIFE</span></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-align:center"">by Anne Frank</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      It was a hard time for the Jews. The fate of many would be decided in 1942. In July they began to round up boys and girls and deport them. Luckily Cady's girl friend Mary seemed to have been forgotten. Later it wasn't just the young people, no one was spared. In the fall and winter Cady went through terrible experiences. Night after night she heard cars driving down the street, she heard children screaming and doors being slammed. Mr. and Mrs. Van Altenhoven looked at each other and Cady in the lamplight, and in their eyes the question could be read: ""Whom will they take tomorrow?""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      One evening in December, Cady decided to run over to Mary's house and cheer her up a little. That night the noise in the street was worse than ever. Cady rang three times at the Hopkens's and when Mary came to the front of the house and looked cautiously out of the window, she called out her name to reassure her. Cady was let in. The whole family sat waiting in gym suits, with packs on their backs. They all looked pale and didn't say a word when Cady stepped into the room. Would they sit there like this every night for months? The sight of all these pale, frightened faces was terrible. Every time a door slammed outside, a shock went through the people sitting there. Those slamming doors seemed to symbolize the slamming of the door of life.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      At ten o'clock Cady took her leave. She saw there was no point in her sitting there, there was nothing she could do to help or comfort these people, who already seemed to be in another world. The only one who kept her courage up a little was Mary. She nodded to Cady from time to time and tried desperately to get her parents and sisters to eat something.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Mary took her to the door and bolted it after her. Cady started home with her little flashlight. She hadn't taken five steps when she stopped still and listened; she heard steps around the corner, a whole regiment of soldiers. She couldn't see much in the darkness, but she knew very well who was coming and what it meant. She flattened herself against a wall, switched off her light, and hoped the men wouldn't see her. Then suddenly one of them stopped in front of her, brandishing a pistol and looking at her with threatening eyes and a cruel face. ""Come!""That was all he said, and immediately she was roughly seized and led away.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      ""I'm a Christian girl of respectable parents,"" she managed to say. She trembled from top to toe and wondered what this brute would do to her. At all costs she must try to show him her identity card.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      ""What do you mean respectable? Let's see your card.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Cady took it out of her pocket.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      ""Why didn't you say so right away?"" the man said as he looked at it. <span class=""stressed_text_2"">""So ein Lumpenpack!""*</span> Before she knew it she was lying on the street. Furious over his own mistake, the German had given the ""respectable Christian girl"" a violent shove. Without a thought for her pain or anything else, Cady stood up and ran home.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      After that night a week passed before Cady had a chance to visit Mary. But one afternoon she took time off, regardless of her work or other appointments. Before she got to the Hopkens's house she was as good as sure she wouldn't find Mary there, and, indeed, when she came to the door, it was sealed up.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Cady was seized with despair. ""Who knows,"" she thought, ""where Mary is now?"" She turned around and went straight back home. She went to her room and slammed the door. With her coat still on, she threw herself down on the sofa, and thought and thought about Mary.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Why did Mary have to go away when she, Cady, could stay here? Why did Mary have to suffer her terrible fate when <span class=""stressed_text_2"">she</span> was left to enjoy herself? What difference was there between them? Was she better than Mary in any way? Weren't they exactly the same? What crime had Mary committed? Oh, this could only be a terrible injustice. And suddenly she saw Mary's little figure before her, shut up in a cell, dressed in rags, with a sunken, emaciated face. Her eyes were very big, and she looked at Cady so sadly and reproachfully. Cady couldn't stand it anymore, she fell on her knees and cried and cried, cried till her whole body shook. Over and over again she saw Mary's eyes begging for help, help that Cady knew she couldn't give her.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      ""Mary, forgive me, come back...""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Cady no longer knew what to say or to think. For this misery that she saw so clearly before her eyes there were no words. Doors slammed in her ears, she heard children crying and in front of her she saw a troop of armed brutes, just like the one who had pushed her into the mud, and in among them, helpless and alone, Mary, Mary who was the same as she was.</div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_2"">* ""Such a bunch of scoundrels.""</span></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""font-size:85%;"">Excerpted from <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Cady's Life</span> by Anne Frank.

They seem to have always been on the move, searching for a better place to live. From America's first colonies small groups of people uprooted themselves, migrating westward to look for better farmland. They built pioneer roads, or trails, such as the Cumberland Road that led into the Ohio Valley, and the Genesee Road that led across New York to the shores of Lake Erie. Many of these roads and trails have disappeared. Others can still be traced, revealing artifacts along the way that help us to recreate their story.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The Oregon Trail is one of these trails. Even today you can retrace its path, walking beside wagon ruts that were gouged almost a century and a half ago. The Oregon Trail was different from the earlier trails and roads that had crossed the Appalachian Mountains in the East. It was longer and more difficult than most pioneers had experienced. Unlike the eastern trails, the Oregon Trail crossed nearly 2,000 miles of unfamiliar prairie, desert, and mountainous regions. There were no settlements along the way that could offer friendly hospitality, and emigrants couldn't scout out their new homeland before they moved there. Oregon Country was so far away, it took from four to six months to get there. When people moved there, they moved to stay.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The story of the Oregon Trail and the people who used it begins when the trail was an ancient Indian footpath used by explorers and fur traders. Independence, Missouri, was the frontier town that served as the starting place. The trail wound westward, following the banks of the Platte, North Platte, and Snake Rivers. It crossed the Rockies through the South Pass, crossed the Blue Mountains further north, and ended in Oregon Country at a place called The Dalles. From The Dalles, anyone continuing on to the Williamette Valley floated down the Columbia River. Up until the mid-1830s, no wagon had ever made the trip.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It is difficult for us to imagine Oregon Country as it was a century and a half ago. A vast wilderness that stretched from the crest of the Rockies to the Pacific coast, it included the present states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The area was inhabited by several tribes of Indians, including the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Nez Perce. There were some trappers and traders in the region, but to most, the area was too far away and too strange for them to consider settling there.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     President Thomas Jefferson was the first to actively encourage exploration of Oregon Country. After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, he sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark into the area to seek a trade route to the Pacific. Jefferson knew that their explorations would help the United States strengthen its claim to the Pacific Northwest.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It is important to remember that for the first half of the nineteenth century both Great Britain and the United States occupied the Pacific Northwest. Great Britain already had a strong claim to the land that was to become Canada, and the Hudson's Bay Company had many fur trading posts in the Pacific Northwest. There were American fur trading posts as well, such as the American Fur Company organized by John Jacob Astor in 1808.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     In 1818, Great Britain and the United States signed a treaty that allowed both countries to occupy the area, but it was not until the 1830s that Americans began moving in. Missionaries, such as Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, were among the first settlers. When people learned that the Whitmans had journeyed successfully over the Oregon Trail in 1836, they began to think differently about Oregon Country. The fact that a woman had made the journey safely, and that the Whitmans had traveled with a wagon, encouraged others to think that they could make the journey, too.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     In fact, when Dr. Whitman returned East in 1842 to help promote his missionary work, he found many people who were eager to travel to Oregon Country. In 1843, some 1,000 people and 2,000 animals joined Dr. Whitman and a surveyor named Jesse Applegate as they led a wagon train over the Oregon Trail. The ""great migration"" — one of the greatest migrations in recorded history — had begun.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Why were so many people going to Oregon Country? Some said they had Oregon fever, a ""disease"" that made them restless, hungry for new land, and eager for adventure. But why were they going all the way to Oregon Country? One very important reason was that the United States government was encouraging them to do so. Since Thomas Jefferson's presidency, our government had come a long way toward believing that the United States should stretch from coast to coast. If Americans were to settle the Oregon Country in large numbers, our claim to the land would be strengthened.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     One man in particular wrote reports about the Oregon Country that were designed to make people want to go there. His name was John Charles Frémont (1813-90). He was a soldier, explorer and political leader who, in 1838, was asked to be the chief assistant in mapping the upper waters of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. He wrote very detailed descriptions of his explorations, and his reports were reprinted and read by many people. It was Frémont who wrote guidebooks for emigrants who were encouraged to settle in Oregon Country and help wrest it from British control.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     As Americans began pouring into the Williamette River valley in the 1840s, a dispute between Great Britain and the United States almost caused a war. The biggest disagreement was over the northern boundary of the Oregon Country. The British wanted the boundary to be on the north bank of the Columbia River. The Americans wanted it further north on the 54th Parallel. After careful negotiations, war was prevented when the two countries signed the Oregon Treaty of 1846. They agreed to compromise, placing the boundary on the 49th Parallel extending to Puget sound and leaving Vancouver Island as a part of Canada.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The Oregon Treaty gave the United States undisputed claim to the Pacific Northwest, encouraging even more emigrants to move west. By the 1850s, the Oregon Trail had become a series of parallel wagon ruts that could be seen even in solid rock. Oregon Country officially became the Oregon Territory in 1848. In 1859, the state of Oregon was created and admitted to the Union as the 33rd state. Twenty years earlier the area had been an unknown wilderness!</div><div class=""paragraph"">     What was it like to travel on the Oregon Trail in the 1840s and 1850s? Fortunately there are many accounts that have survived, written by the people who used the trail and who wanted to preserve their experiences for later generations. The story of the Sager children was preserved by three of the Sager girls who survived. Diaries, such as the one handed down to Jean Burroughs, provide eyewitness accounts of the daily travel. When we read these accounts, we can easily imagine the hardship, the anxiety, and the excitement the emigrants must have experienced.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     According to several historians, at least 30,000 emigrants died on the Oregon Trail between 1843 and 1859. You might say that there is an average of one grave for every 100 yards of trail from the Missouri River to the Williamette River! Why did so many people die? Cholera, a disease that spreads when there are filthy conditions caused by garbage and sewage, claimed thousands of lives. Emigrants passed through, and sometimes camped near, the refuse left by earlier wagon trains. Other diseases caused people to die, but cholera was probably the most common.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Accident was another common cause of death. Children often hurt themselves as the wagons rolled along. Doctors were not always available, and even when they were they often lacked necessary supplies. Most of the emigrants were simply not prepared for the difficult journey ahead, and they were careless.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     There were some problems as the emigrants passed through Indian territory. Indian attacks usually took the form of raids on the livestock, but few people were ever killed. The Indians owned much of the land on both sides of the Oregon Trail, and the emigrants were trespassing. Some tribal leaders demanded payment as the wagon trains rolled through, and, if the emigrants cooperated, there was no further trouble. In other instances, the Indians made a surprise attack, took livestock, and left the wagons unharmed.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It would be several years later, in the 1860s, when the Indians would finally realize that their homelands had been lost forever. Tribal chiefs, such as Red Cloud and Crazy Horse, both of the Oglala Sioux, devoted their lives to trying to save their homelands and people. But the idea that the United States should stretch from coast to coast had already taken hold. The Oregon Trail, no longer just a footpath, had opened the way to the West.</div><div class=""paragraph"">From Cobblestone's December, 1981, issue: <span class=""stressed_text_2"">The Oregon Trail.</span> © 1981, Cobblestone Publishing Inc., Peterborough, NH 03458.

See what you can land. Every family in our wagon train needs fresh fish for supper."" Nettie Emory's father stood by her on the banks of the North Platte River late one evening in June, 1863. ""And mind you keep your shoes on this time, Pet.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie drew down the corners of her mouth in disappointment. She'd been counting on cool water and squishy mud to cool her feet, hot and sweaty from her high–topped, laced shoes. She knew her father was referring to the time she had wandered from camp to gather ""yellow roses,""the enticing blooms of prickly pear cactus. Stepping on dozens of stickers in her bare feet was a painful experience she would never forget. She'd never seen cactus before so how was she supposed to know?</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Now, holding her line and hook high, Nettie edged closer to the water, hoping against hope she would catch a fish. Otherwise, it was going to be salt bacon and corn pone for supper again. After several weeks on the Oregon Trail, their supply of meat was used up. Even wild game had been scarce, and they had not yet reached the plentiful buffalo on the plains. She was certainly tired of the monotonous diet.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie's father called back over his shoulder. ""Remember there's quicksand and sinkholes. Test the ground before you step. Stay close to me. Good luck, Blackie.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie grinned at her father's use of her nickname, given because of her unusually dark hair and eyes. Her French mother preferred Minette, but had agreed to the shortened form of Nettie. An only child, the nine–year–old girl answered to all the names that her loving parents called her. She was proud that her father had been chosen wagon master to lead the train over the plains and mountains to faraway Oregon. Perhaps if she caught a fish, he'd be proud of her too, just as he was when she drove the ox team safely during her mother's illness. She wanted to help him during this difficult journey as much as she could.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     She watched him and the other men choose places to cast their lines at the water's edge. Some waded into the shallows near the sand islands in the river where the current was running swifter because of a recent rain. Through a thicket of willows she edged closer to where a quiet pool had formed under the tree roots. Just the place for a fish to hide, she thought. She quietly dropped her hook, watching it sink to the bottom. Then she waited, swinging her sun-bonnet strings back and forth to brush off the gnats and mosquitoes that hummed around her face.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     She waited. She waited, but no fish rose to her bait. As she slid down the riverbank she kept her father's black hat in sight. Her line drifted faster with the fresh current. Fishing can be tiresome, she fretted, but it's better than just watching the trail from the back of our crowded wagon.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     None of the men had caught a fish so far. She squinted at the sun, well above the horizon of the summer sky. There's plenty of time before supper fires are lighted, she thought. With her left hand she slapped at a pesky mosquito again; her right hand tightened its grip on the pole. A sudden jerk on the line caused her to stumble forward to keep her balance. A bite! A bite! The pull on her line was steady and strong. She lifted her pole and it bent forward. It surely must be a big one.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     And it was a big one, big enough to pull Nettie dangerously toward the water. Her breath came in gasps. She dug in the heels of her sturdy shoes, glad now that she wasn't barefoot. She couldn't back up because the end of the line was moving fast toward the center of the river. She could no longer see her father's hat because of the tall rushes growing at water's edge.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Grimly, she held on. Her feet were already soaked. Would her next step be into quicksand? The line moved downstream, dragging Nettie into ankle–deep, then knee–deep water. She was excited about the catch and dared not let go. She also was becoming a little frightened.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Papa, Papa, I've got a big one!"" she cried. ""It's pulling me into the river!"" Her voice was lost in the evening breeze that stirred the rushes. ""Papa, can't you hear me?""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     How much longer could she hold on? She used all her strength. Her shoulders ached from the strain. ""Help! Help!"" she shouted to anyone who might hear her. She turned her body so that the line wrapped around her hips. Her legs sank deeper into the sandy bottom. Muddy water billowed out her full skirt. ""I'm like an umbrella,"" she laughed to herself. ""Now maybe they'll see me.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Fresh fish or dry salt bacon: the very thought gave her extra endurance. Not just for her own family, but the other wagon people who were also hungry for a change in diet. Drawing a deeper breath, she called hoarsely, ""Save me! Save my fish!""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     An answering shout gave her courage. She heard footsteps splashing nearer. ""Blackie, hold on. Pull back,"" called her father. Other men dropped their poles and ran to help. Josiah Emory placed his body in front of his little girl's, grabbing the line with his strong hands. Nettie clung to the pole while her father slowly, steadily, pulled in the line. Soon a flashing, grey body flapped in and out of the water. ""It's a big catfish, Blackie, a really huge one. Good girl! I'm proud of you."" Only then did Nettie let go. He lifted the pole with a grunt at the unexpected weight. Indeed, it was a huge fish. Her father guessed it was over three feet long and more than twenty-five pounds.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Sloshing back to the wagon, muddy and exhausted, Nettie wondered what her mother would say. Her dress and petticoats were caked with red mud. Her shoes squished water through the laces. Now perhaps I can go barefoot until my shoes dry, she thought. She hoped her mother would be so glad over the fish that she wouldn't scold.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     News of Nettie's big catch spread among the wagons. A hungry crowd gathered to watch while Nettie's father dressed the fish. ""Build up the fire,"" he said. ""We'll all feast tonight. No ration of salt pork but fresh fish for all.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""And biscuits and syrup instead of corn bread?"" Nettie asked her mother.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Yes, Minette. All the biscuits and syrup and fish you can eat.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie grinned a happy, tired grin. ""I'll always remember how that fish almost swam away with me. I am going to write about it in my diary.""</div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">A Note from the Author:</span></div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_2"">     This is a true story.

They seem to have always been on the move, searching for a better place to live. From America's first colonies small groups of people uprooted themselves, migrating westward to look for better farmland. They built pioneer roads, or trails, such as the Cumberland Road that led into the Ohio Valley, and the Genesee Road that led across New York to the shores of Lake Erie. Many of these roads and trails have disappeared. Others can still be traced, revealing artifacts along the way that help us to recreate their story.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The Oregon Trail is one of these trails. Even today you can retrace its path, walking beside wagon ruts that were gouged almost a century and a half ago. The Oregon Trail was different from the earlier trails and roads that had crossed the Appalachian Mountains in the East. It was longer and more difficult than most pioneers had experienced. Unlike the eastern trails, the Oregon Trail crossed nearly 2,000 miles of unfamiliar prairie, desert, and mountainous regions. There were no settlements along the way that could offer friendly hospitality, and emigrants couldn't scout out their new homeland before they moved there. Oregon Country was so far away, it took from four to six months to get there. When people moved there, they moved to stay.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The story of the Oregon Trail and the people who used it begins when the trail was an ancient Indian footpath used by explorers and fur traders. Independence, Missouri, was the frontier town that served as the starting place. The trail wound westward, following the banks of the Platte, North Platte, and Snake Rivers. It crossed the Rockies through the South Pass, crossed the Blue Mountains further north, and ended in Oregon Country at a place called The Dalles. From The Dalles, anyone continuing on to the Williamette Valley floated down the Columbia River. Up until the mid-1830s, no wagon had ever made the trip.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It is difficult for us to imagine Oregon Country as it was a century and a half ago. A vast wilderness that stretched from the crest of the Rockies to the Pacific coast, it included the present states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The area was inhabited by several tribes of Indians, including the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Nez Perce. There were some trappers and traders in the region, but to most, the area was too far away and too strange for them to consider settling there.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     President Thomas Jefferson was the first to actively encourage exploration of Oregon Country.

You might say that there is an average of one grave for every 100 yards of trail from the Missouri River to the Williamette River! Why did so many people die? Cholera, a disease that spreads when there are filthy conditions caused by garbage and sewage, claimed thousands of lives. Emigrants passed through, and sometimes camped near, the refuse left by earlier wagon trains. Other diseases caused people to die, but cholera was probably the most common.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Accident was another common cause of death.

Her voice was lost in the evening breeze that stirred the rushes. ""Papa, can't you hear me?""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     How much longer could she hold on? She used all her strength. Her shoulders ached from the strain. ""Help! Help!"" she shouted to anyone who might hear her. She turned her body so that the line wrapped around her hips. Her legs sank deeper into the sandy bottom. Muddy water billowed out her full skirt. ""I'm like an umbrella,"" she laughed to herself. ""Now maybe they'll see me.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Fresh fish or dry salt bacon: the very thought gave her extra endurance. Not just for her own family, but the other wagon people who were also hungry for a change in diet. Drawing a deeper breath, she called hoarsely, ""Save me! Save my fish!""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     An answering shout gave her courage. She heard footsteps splashing nearer. ""Blackie, hold on. Pull back,"" called her father. Other men dropped their poles and ran to help. Josiah Emory placed his body in front of his little girl's, grabbing the line with his strong hands. Nettie clung to the pole while her father slowly, steadily, pulled in the line. Soon a flashing, grey body flapped in and out of the water. ""It's a big catfish, Blackie, a really huge one. Good girl! I'm proud of you."" Only then did Nettie let go. He lifted the pole with a grunt at the unexpected weight. Indeed, it was a huge fish. Her father guessed it was over three feet long and more than twenty-five pounds.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Sloshing back to the wagon, muddy and exhausted, Nettie wondered what her mother would say. Her dress and petticoats were caked with red mud. Her shoes squished water through the laces. Now perhaps I can go barefoot until my shoes dry, she thought. She hoped her mother would be so glad over the fish that she wouldn't scold.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     News of Nettie's big catch spread among the wagons. A hungry crowd gathered to watch while Nettie's father dressed the fish. ""Build up the fire,"" he said. ""We'll all feast tonight. No ration of salt pork but fresh fish for all.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""And biscuits and syrup instead of corn bread?"" Nettie asked her mother.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Yes, Minette. All the biscuits and syrup and fish you can eat.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie grinned a happy, tired grin. ""I'll always remember how that fish almost swam away with me. I am going to write about it in my diary.""</div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">A Note from the Author:</span></div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_2"">     This is a true story. A copy of Nettie Emory's diary was given to me by her granddaughter. From Nettie's entries about her trip on the Oregon Trail, written in 1863, I have retold her exciting adventure with the big fish. Of course I used imaginary conversation and descriptions. This is what Nettie wrote in her diary:</span></div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_2"">     ""I was allowed to fish with the men in the Missouri River. Suddenly a fish took my bait, and I was pulled to the water's edge. My father heard my call for help. He began to run when he saw me splashing in the water. Other men helped him land the fish while I went back to the wagon to dry out. The fish was over three feet long and weighed about 25 pounds. I was the only one who caught a fish that day but we shared it with the others.""</span></div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">From Cobblestone's December, 1981, issue: <span class=""stressed_text_2"">The Oregon Trail.</span> © 1981, Cobblestone Publishing Inc., Peterborough, NH 03458.

They cooked their first suppers in the field that night at nine o'clock, and wrapped themselves in their blankets, to be awakened by the roar of battle, and receive, thus early, their bloody baptism. Before they had been on the field one day, their magnificent corps was decimated, most of the officers killed.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      On going to the field the second day, our regiment strode on in line over wounded, dying, and dead. My office detaching me from the lines, I had an opportunity to notice incidents about the field. The regiment halted amidst a gory, ghastly scene. I heard a voice calling, ""Ho, friend! ho! Come here."" I went to a pile of dead human forms in every kind of stiff contortion; I saw one arm raised, beckoning me. I found there a rebel, covered with blood, pillowing his head on the dead body of a comrade. Both were red from head to foot. The live one had lain across the dead one all that horrible, long night in the storm. The first thing he said to me was ""Give me some water. Send me a surgeon—won't you! What made you come down here to fight us? We never would have come up there."" And then he affectionately put one arm over the form, and laid his bloody face against the cold, clammy, bloody face of his friend.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      I filled his canteen nearly—reserving some for myself—knowing that I might be in the same sad condition. I told him we had no surgeon in our regiment, and that we would have to suffer, if wounded, the same as he; that other regiments were coming, and to call on them for surgeon; that they were humane.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      ""Forward!"" shouted the Colonel; and 'Forward' was repeated by the officers. I left him.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      The above recalls to mind one of the hardest principles in warfare—where your sympathy and humanity are appealed to, and from sense of expediency, you are forbidden to exercise it. After our regiment had been nearly annihilated, and were compelled to retreat under a galling fire, a boy was supporting his dying brother on one arm, and trying to drag him from the field and the advancing foe. He looked at me imploringly, and said, ""Captain, help him—won't you? Do, Captain; he'll live."" I said, ""He's shot through the head; don't you see? and can't live—he's dying now."" ""Oh, no, he ain't, Captain. Don't leave me."" I was forced to reply, ""The rebels won't hurt him. Lay him down and come, or both you and I will be lost.""The rush of bullets and the yells of the approaching enemy hurried me away—leaving the young soldier over his dying brother.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      At home I used to wince at the sight of a wound or of a corpse; but here, in one day, I learned to be among the scenes I am describing without emotion. My friend and myself, on the second night, looking in the dark for a place to lie down, he said, ""Let's lie down here. Here's some fellows sleeping.""We slept in quiet until dawn revealed that we had passed the night among sprawling, stiffened, ghastly corpses. I saw one of our dead soldiers with his mouth crammed full of cartridges until the cheeks were bulged out. Several protruded from his mouth. This was done by the rebels. On the third day most of our time was employed in burying the dead. Shallow pits were dug, which would soon fill with water. Into these we threw our comrades with a heavy splash, or a dump against solid bottom.

The first great battle of the war had been fought at Bull Run (Manassas) in Virginia in July 1861, nearly a year before. It had ended in a temporary stalemate in the eastern theater. In the West, Kentucky tried to remain neutral, but by the end of 1861, both sides had sent troops into the state.</img></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      In February 1862, Union General Ulysses S. Grant captured forts Henry and Donelson on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in northern Tennessee near the Kentucky boundary, taking about 11,500 men and 40 guns. The whole Confederate line of defense across Kentucky gave way. The Confederates were forced to retreat to Murfreesboro, Tenn., southeast of Nashville, as other Union forces moved toward Nashville.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      With the Southern press clamoring for his removal, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, commanding the Confederate forces in the region, began to assemble the scattered troops. He decided to designate Corinth, in the northeast corner of Mississippi, as the concentration point for the army.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Assembling of the Armies.</span> By the end of March, Johnston and his second-in-command, Gen. Pierre G.T. Beauregard, managed to gather in Corinth more than 40,000 men, including a few units from as far away as the Gulf of Mexico. These were organized into three corps, commanded by Gens. Leonidas Polk, Braxton Bragg, and William J. Hardee. There was also a small reserve corps under Gen. John C. Breckinridge.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Meanwhile, Gen. Henry W. Halleck, who was Grant's department commander, had ordered Grant's troops to make a reconnaissance southward along the Tennessee River. They encamped near Pittsburg Landing, on the west side of the river, about 5 miles (8 km) north of the Mississippi boundary. There they awaited the arrival of another large Union force under Gen. Don Carlos Buell, which had been ordered southward from Nashville to join them.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Grant's army of 42,000 men was divided into six divisions. Five of these, a total of 37,000, were near Pittsburg Landing. One division, under Gen. Lew Wallace's command, was stationed 6 miles (9 km) to the north. Buell's army marching from Nashville was almost as large as Grant's; together they would far outnumber the concentration of forces that the Confederates could put in the field.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      General Johnston saw that he must strike Grant's army before Buell arrived. The Confederates started northward from Corinth on the afternoon of April 3, intending to attack at dawn on the 5th, but a violent rainstorm turned the dirt roads into a sea of mud. The attack was postponed from the 5th to Sunday, April 6, but on the 5th the leading division of Buell's army arrived on the other side of the Tennessee River, only 7 miles (11 km) away.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-align:center""><img align=""middle"" alt=""The Battle of Shiloh Map Image"" height=""594"" src=""./ReadMed_files/ItemResource(45)"" title=""The Battle of Shiloh Map Image"" width=""400""/></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      That night the armies encamped only 2 miles (3 km) apart, with the Union forces, whose advanced units were about 4 miles (6 km) away up the river, wholly unaware of their danger. Neither they nor their leaders expected an attack. They were not disposed for defense, nor had any trenches been dug for their protection. Early in the morning of April 6, a suspicious brigade commander in Gen. Benjamin M. Prentiss' Union division sent a small force forward to investigate the nearby woods. At dawn they exchanged shots with the Confederates, but it was too late to give warning of the attack, which burst on the Union camps.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Confederate Attack.</span> For the assault, General Johnston had chosen an unusual formation. He formed his troops in three lines, with Hardee's corps in front, Bragg's corps in a second parallel line, and then Polk's and Breckenridge's reserve corps.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      The Confederates charged straight to their front into the divisions of Prestiss and Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, who held the right flank near the Old Shiloh Church. They and Gen. John A. McClernand's division made a brief stand. Many men fought valiantly, but others broke and fled. When Grant who had been absent from the field, arrived he found all five of the divisions fighting desperately in what seemed like a hopeless struggle. He had already sent for Buell's troops, and now he sent for Lew Wallace to join him.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      The Union forces had retreated about halfway to the river to a new position, naturally strong, with open fields on each side and a sunken road in front. Here, in the center, in a position known to history as ""The Hornets' Nest"", the Confederates were halted for hours. They could not take it by assault, but gradually the Union troops on each flank were forced back. Johnston fell mortally wounded. Beauregard took command, and the attack continued.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Finally ""The Hornets' Nest""was surrounded. Gen. William H.L.

They cooked their first suppers in the field that night at nine o'clock, and wrapped themselves in their blankets, to be awakened by the roar of battle, and receive, thus early, their bloody baptism. Before they had been on the field one day, their magnificent corps was decimated, most of the officers killed.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      On going to the field the second day, our regiment strode on in line over wounded, dying, and dead. My office detaching me from the lines, I had an opportunity to notice incidents about the field. The regiment halted amidst a gory, ghastly scene. I heard a voice calling, ""Ho, friend! ho! Come here."" I went to a pile of dead human forms in every kind of stiff contortion; I saw one arm raised, beckoning me. I found there a rebel, covered with blood, pillowing his head on the dead body of a comrade. Both were red from head to foot. The live one had lain across the dead one all that horrible, long night in the storm. The first thing he said to me was ""Give me some water. Send me a surgeon—won't you! What made you come down here to fight us? We never would have come up there."" And then he affectionately put one arm over the form, and laid his bloody face against the cold, clammy, bloody face of his friend.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      I filled his canteen nearly—reserving some for myself—knowing that I might be in the same sad condition. I told him we had no surgeon in our regiment, and that we would have to suffer, if wounded, the same as he; that other regiments were coming, and to call on them for surgeon; that they were humane.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      ""Forward!"" shouted the Colonel; and 'Forward' was repeated by the officers. I left him.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      The above recalls to mind one of the hardest principles in warfare—where your sympathy and humanity are appealed to, and from sense of expediency, you are forbidden to exercise it. After our regiment had been nearly annihilated, and were compelled to retreat under a galling fire, a boy was supporting his dying brother on one arm, and trying to drag him from the field and the advancing foe. He looked at me imploringly, and said, ""Captain, help him—won't you? Do, Captain; he'll live."" I said, ""He's shot through the head; don't you see? and can't live—he's dying now."" ""Oh, no, he ain't, Captain. Don't leave me."" I was forced to reply, ""The rebels won't hurt him. Lay him down and come, or both you and I will be lost.""The rush of bullets and the yells of the approaching enemy hurried me away—leaving the young soldier over his dying brother.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      At home I used to wince at the sight of a wound or of a corpse; but here, in one day, I learned to be among the scenes I am describing without emotion. My friend and myself, on the second night, looking in the dark for a place to lie down, he said, ""Let's lie down here. Here's some fellows sleeping.""We slept in quiet until dawn revealed that we had passed the night among sprawling, stiffened, ghastly corpses. I saw one of our dead soldiers with his mouth crammed full of cartridges until the cheeks were bulged out. Several protruded from his mouth. This was done by the rebels. On the third day most of our time was employed in burying the dead. Shallow pits were dug, which would soon fill with water. Into these we threw our comrades with a heavy splash, or a dump against solid bottom. Many a hopeful, promising youth thus indecently ended his career.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      I stood in one place in the woods near the spot of the engagement of the 57th Illinois, and counted eighty-one dead rebels.
