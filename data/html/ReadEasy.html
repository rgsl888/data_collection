The story, an intact section taken from a longer book, recounts the feelings of a young boy as he travels to and arrives in the Dominican Republic.  The story portrays his mixed feelings about Dominican culture, his family members, and the trip.</div><div class="paragraph">A young boy, Miguel and his sisters Juanita are taking their first trip to the Dominican Republic, from which their parents immigrated to the United States.  They are being taken to the Dominican Republic for the Christmas holiday by their mother.  Travelling with them is Tia Lola, their aunt who has spent most of her life in the Dominican Republic.</div><div class="paragraph">As the story open, Miguel is looking down from the window at the landscape coming into view as the plane moves closer and closer to their destination.  Lost in anxious thought about what the island will be like, he doesn't listen to Tia Lola's lessons about Dominican culture. When the plane touches down he wishes that he had.</div><div class="paragraph">Waiting in the passport line, Miguel asserts his identity as an American, but as he looks around he realizes that he looks more like the Dominicans than his friends back in Vermont.  Soon Miguel is surrounded by a crowd of cousins, aunts, and uncles.  When one of his cousins asks him if he plays baseball, all Miguel's anxiety dissipates and he smiles.<span class="stressed-text-3"></span></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:9pt">We did not receive copyright approval to use the text of the passage as it appeared in the student booklets on the website.

              A certain man had a garden which was filled with beautiful plants and vines. In one corner grew a rose tree, which bore the most fragrant blossoms in the garden, and was therefore the man's greatest pride. Every morning, when he walked among his flowers, he brought fresh water to sprinkle this rose tree, so that it might never be parched by the heat. And in the winter he covered it most carefully with straw, lest the frost should chill its delicate roots.
            </div><div class="paragraph">
              One morning as he was bringing the water, he saw a nightingale perched on one of the branches of the rose tree. The bird was hopping about and playfully pulling one of the most beautiful roses to pieces. The angry man drove the bird away; but when he came the next morning, he found that the nightingale had returned, and that the ground beneath the rose tree was covered with torn petals. This time the man was so angry that he laid a snare to catch the bird. The third morning, when he came out into his garden, the roses were unharmed, for the nightingale was caught fast in the snare. The man hurried to fetch a cage, and carried the captive home.
            </div><div class="paragraph">
              The nightingale was very sad as she beat about the cage, and finally besought the man to tell her why it was that he had imprisoned her. "Was it to hear my song?" she asked. "But it cannot be for that," she added, "for do I not sing sweetly to you every evening from my nest in the garden?"

Take it and use it for your garden!" And singing sweetly, the nightingale flew away to her nest.

Was it kind? Was it honest? Was it beneficial? Was it generous? Was it necessary? And (my favorite) was it selfless?</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pleasure got to be the main thing, the fun fetish was sure to follow. Everything was supposed to be fun. If it wasn't fun, then we were going to make it fun, or else.</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of all the things that got the reputation of being fun. Family outings were supposed to be fun. Education was supposed to be fun. Work was supposed to be fun. Walt Disney was supposed to be fun. Church was supposed to be fun. Staying fit was supposed to be fun.</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to make sure that everybody knew how much fun we were having, we put happy faces on flunking test papers, dirty bumpers, sticky refrigerator doors, bathroom mirrors.</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a kid, looking at his very happy parents traipsing through that very happy Disney World, said, "This ain't fun, ma," his ma's heart sank. She wondered where she had gone wrong. Everybody told her what fun family outings to Disney World would be. Golly gee, what was the matter?</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fun got to be such a big thing that everybody started to look for more and more thrilling ways to supply it. One way was to step up the level of danger so that you could be sure that, no matter what, you would manage to have a little fun.</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Television commercials brought a lot of fun and fun-loving folks into the picture. Everything that people in those commercials did looked like fun: taking Polaroid snapshots, buying insurance, mopping the floor, bowling, taking aspirin. The more commercials people watched, the more they wondered when the fun would start in their own lives. It was pretty depressing.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center">Page 3</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big occasions were supposed to be fun. Christmas, Thanksgiving and Easter were obviously supposed to be fun. Your wedding day was supposed to be fun. Your honeymoon was supposed to be the epitome of fundom. And so we ended up going through every Big Event we ever celebrated, waiting for the fun to start.</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It occurred to me, while I was sitting around waiting for the fun to start, that not much is, and that I should tell you just in case you're worried about your fun capacity.</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't mean to put a damper on things. I just mean we ought to treat fun reverently. It is a mystery. It cannot be caught like a virus. It cannot be trapped like an animal. The god of mirth is paying us back for all those years of thinking fun was everywhere by refusing to come to our party. I don't want to blaspheme fun anymore. When fun comes in on little dancing feet, you probably won't be expecting it. In fact, I bet it comes when you're doing your duty, your job, or your work. It may even come on a Tuesday.</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember one day, long ago, on which I had an especially good time. Pam Davis and I walked to the College Village drug store one Saturday morning to buy some candy. We were about 12 years old. She got her Bit-O-Honey. I got my malted milk balls, chocolate stars, Chunkys, and a small bag of M &amp;amp;amp; M's. We started back to her house. I was going to spend the night. We had the whole day to look forward to. We had plenty of candy. It was a long way to Pam's house but every time we got weary Pam would put her hand over her eyes, scan the horizon like a sailor and say, "Oughta reach home by nightfall," at which point the two of us would laugh until we thought we couldn't stand it another minute. Then after we got calm, she'd say it again. You should have been there. It was the kind of day and friendship and occasion that made me deeply regretful that I had to grow up.</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was fun.</div><div class="attrib"><div class="paragraph">From The New York Times, December 13,</div><div class="paragraph">1979, copyright © 1979 by The New York</div><div class="paragraph">Times.

              Fascinated, Daniel followed his grandmother's old fingers while they deftly wove magic in their mathematical dance. Wrinkled folds of skin, draped almost casually over her old bones, moved in ways that mocked his young, but clumsy, fingers. Every motion was elegant choreography, each fold an artful rendition of an exact science. Two days of insistence had finally convinced her to share her secrets. This was the initiation. Her price was his rapt attention.

We had plenty of candy.

While ever careful to refrain from wrongdoing others, we must be no less insistent that we are not wronged ourselves. We wish peace, but we wish the peace of justice, the peace of righteousness. We wish it because we think it is right and not because we are afraid.

Such growth in wealth, in population, and in power as this nation has seen during the century and a quarter of its national life is inevitably accompanied by a like growth in the problems which are ever before every nation that rises to greatness. Power invariably means both responsibility and danger. Our forefathers faced certain perils which we have outgrown. We now face other perils, the very existence of which it was impossible that they should foresee.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px">Modern life is both complex and intense, and the tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary industrial development of the last half century are felt in every fiber of our social and political being. Never before have men tried so vast and formidable an experiment as that of administering the affairs of a continent under the forms of a democratic republic. The conditions which have told for our marvelous material well-being—which have developed to a very high degree our energy, self-reliance, and individual initiative—have also brought the care and anxiety inseparable from the accumulation of great wealth in industrial centers.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center">Page 3</div></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="border-left-style:solid;border-right-style:solid;border-bottom-style:solid" align="center" width="80%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tbody><tr><td><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px">Upon the success of our experiment much depends, not only as regards our own welfare, but as regards the welfare of mankind.

The oath of office was administered on the East Portico of the Capitol by Chief Justice Melville Fuller.</div></td><td><div class="stdaln_img"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(8)" alt="Picture of Theodore Roosevelt" title="Picture of Theodore Roosevelt" height="255px" width="198px" class="inln_img"></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px">MY FELLOW CITIZENS, no people on Earth have more cause to be thankful than ours, and this is said reverently, in no spirit of boastfulness in our own strength, but with gratitude to the Giver of Good who has blessed us with the conditions which have enabled us to achieve so large a measure of well-being and of happiness.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px">To us as a people it has been granted to lay the foundations of our national life in a new continent.

Our life has called for the vigor and effort without which the manlier and hardier virtues wither away.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px">Under such conditions it would be our own fault if we failed; and the success which we have had in the past, the success which we confidently believe the future will bring, should cause in us no feeling of vainglory, but rather a deep and abiding realization of all which life has offered us; a full acknowledgment of the responsibility which is ours; and a fixed determination to show that under a free government a mighty people can thrive best, alike as regards the things of the body and the things of the soul.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center">Page 2</div></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="border-left-style:solid;border-right-style:solid;border-bottom-style:solid" align="center" width="80%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tbody><tr><td><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px">Much has been given us, and much will rightfully be expected from us.

While ever careful to refrain from wrongdoing others, we must be no less insistent that we are not wronged ourselves. We wish peace, but we wish the peace of justice, the peace of righteousness. We wish it because we think it is right and not because we are afraid. No weak nation that acts manfully and justly should ever have cause to fear us, and no strong power should ever be able to single us out as a subject for insolent aggression.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px">Our relations with the other powers of the world are important; but still more important are our relations among ourselves. Such growth in wealth, in population, and in power as this nation has seen during the century and a quarter of its national life is inevitably accompanied by a like growth in the problems which are ever before every nation that rises to greatness. Power invariably means both responsibility and danger. Our forefathers faced certain perils which we have outgrown. We now face other perils, the very existence of which it was impossible that they should foresee.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px">Modern life is both complex and intense, and the tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary industrial development of the last half century are felt in every fiber of our social and political being. Never before have men tried so vast and formidable an experiment as that of administering the affairs of a continent under the forms of a democratic republic. The conditions which have told for our marvelous material well-being—which have developed to a very high degree our energy, self-reliance, and individual initiative—have also brought the care and anxiety inseparable from the accumulation of great wealth in industrial centers.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center">Page 3</div></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="border-left-style:solid;border-right-style:solid;border-bottom-style:solid" align="center" width="80%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tbody><tr><td><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px">Upon the success of our experiment much depends, not only as regards our own welfare, but as regards the welfare of mankind.

              From all corners they come, these words. From Swedish (ombudsman and dynamite) and Basque (bizarre). From Yiddish (meshuganeh and kibbitzing) and Spanish (siesta and coyote). From Finnish (sauna), Russian (apparatchik), Hindi (juggernaut), Sri Lankan Sinhala (anaconda) and Malay (amok). From Japanese (judo), Filipino Tagalog (boondocks) and Arabic via Swahili (safari).

              "English is a free market," said Allan Metcalf, author of The World in So Many Words, a freewheeling exploration of English's imports. "Other languages are homogeneous enough that you can notice foreign words coming in and say, 'That's a terrible thing; keep them out.' But English is multicultural."
            </div><div class="paragraph">
              Viking languages contributed words and grammar to Old English in England's earliest days, but linguists trace the real dawn of importation to 1066, when King William, a Norman from what is now France, conquered England. That meant English speakers were being ruled by French speakers, and the subjugated language had to adjust.
            </div><div class="paragraph">
              The conquerors considered themselves more genteel than the low-country Anglo-Saxons. Animal words—cow, pig, sheep—are out-in-the-barn Anglo-Saxon. Food words for the same beasts—beef, pork, mutton—come from dress-up-for-dinner Norman.
            </div><div class="paragraph">
              By Chaucer's time, 300 years later, Middle English had swelled with French terms such as "reign," "jurisprudence" and "reason," setting a precedent: new words could be foreign and still sound English.
            </div><div class="paragraph">
              During the Renaissance, words flowed in from Latin—not that different from French—and Greek. The Age of Exploration introduced novel terms from all corners. English was becoming a polyglot.
            </div><div class="paragraph">
              And the United States changed everything. Here was an English-speaking land molded by successive generations of immigrants, each bringing new ideas and new expressions. Irish, Italians, Germans, Eastern Europeans, Latinos, Africans, Asians—all changed English in ways minuscule and momentous.

            </div><div class="paragraph">
              "Dunk" owes its origin to German immigrants who belonged to the 18th-century Brethren movement and moved to Pennsylvania to escape religious persecution. They practiced full-immersion Baptism and were known as "tunker;' from the German word "tunken," meaning "to immerse." The "T" evolved into a "D" in Pennsylvania.

              Linguists predict foreign words will flow into English even faster as more non-native speakers reach global leadership positions. The pace will increase, but it will still be English—willing to accept words into its mosaic because of a stubborn legacy of pragmatism nearly 1,000 years old.

I think music chose me."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">In 1925, Marian won a voice contest in New York, and sang with the New York Philharmonic. Still, her chances to perform in the United States were limited.

She understood that the way the controversy with the DAR was resolved would be a milestone for civil rights.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Despite public outcry, the DAR would not back down and let Marian sing. With Mrs. Roosevelt's support, the Secretary of the Interior arranged a special concert for Marian, to be held at the Lincoln Memorial. Seventy-five thousand people attended. In many ways, Marian's concert was considered to be America's first civil rights rally. That night, she took a stand against discrimination and for equality. The first words she sang were: "My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing."</div></div></td><td align="left"><div class="prose2"><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">The Open-Hearted Way</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Marian realized that equality in the United States would be achieved when every person was willing to stand up for what is right.

She performed in many prestigious locations, including Constitution Hall, where she sang after the DAR changed its policies. By 1954, segregation was declared unconstitutional. The Civil Rights Act was signed into law in 1964, the year Marian retired from performing. By then, many of the barriers she'd had to fight through were disappearing.

A set of eight bronze duckling statues with their mother, that's what! They are made for hugging, climbing on, and "feeding." They were created by the sculptor Nancy Schön (pronounced "shern"). She based them on the ducklings in the famous children's book <span class="stressed_text_2">Make Way for Ducklings.</span></div><div class="paragraph">The ducklings in the book hatched from the drawing pencil of author Robert McCloskey back in 1941. In the story, the ducklings followed their proud mother around the Public Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. They learned to "walk in a line, to come when they were called, and to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels."</div></div><div class="prose2"><div class="paragraph">But the duckling statues started in a very different way almost fifty years later.</div><div class="paragraph">Ms. Schön, who had been making sculptures of people for years, noticed that children love to play with animal statues. At the same time, the six-year-old twin boys of an English friend of hers visited the Public Garden. They had read <span class="stressed_text_2">Make Way for Ducklings,</span> and they were puzzled. "Mummy, where are the ducks?" they asked. </div><div class="paragraph">Ms. Schön's friend suggested that she bring the famous little birds to life. Mr. McCloskey himself was delighted with the idea. He encouraged the sculptor to start by copying his own drawings. </div><div class="paragraph">"Just to be different. I chose eight of the poses of the ducks that I liked best," explains Ms. Schön.

She wanted to remind people how the ducklings in the book waddled from the Charles River, across busy Beacon Street, and right into the Public Garden.</div><div class="paragraph">Deciding how big the ducks should be was an important question. Mr. McCloskey himself came to the art studio to help. To get a better look, they dragged the clay models outside on a snowy February day. Just then a group of children at the preschool next door came out and stopped short in surprise.</div><div class="paragraph">Ms. Schön laughs as she remembers. "The children came running and screaming and started to pat and hug them. It was so</div></div><div class="prose2"><div class="paragraph">exciting!" There was no doubt now—the ducklings were perfect. The bronze statues were ready to be made.</div><div class="paragraph">In October 1987, two large and sixteen small webbed feet lined up and came to stay in the Boston Public Garden. Mrs. Mallard stands more than three feet tall, and her children—"Jack, then Kack, and then Lack, followed by Mack and Nack and Ouack and Pack and Quack"—trail proudly behind her, waddling on old rounded Boston cobblestones. Their bright eyes sparkle, inviting children of all ages to touch, hug, and play with them, just as Ms. Schön wanted.</div></div><div class="prose1"><div class="paragraph">Page 2</div></div></div></div><br>83. <div class="paragraph">

A set of eight bronze duckling statues with their mother, that's what! They are made for hugging, climbing on, and "feeding." They were created by the sculptor Nancy Schön (pronounced "shern"). She based them on the ducklings in the famous children's book <span class="stressed_text_2">Make Way for Ducklings.</span></div><div class="paragraph">The ducklings in the book hatched from the drawing pencil of author Robert McCloskey back in 1941. In the story, the ducklings followed their proud mother around the Public Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. They learned to "walk in a line, to come when they were called, and to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels."</div></div><div class="prose2"><div class="paragraph">But the duckling statues started in a very different way almost fifty years later.</div><div class="paragraph">Ms. Schön, who had been making sculptures of people for years, noticed that children love to play with animal statues. At the same time, the six-year-old twin boys of an English friend of hers visited the Public Garden. They had read <span class="stressed_text_2">Make Way for Ducklings,</span> and they were puzzled. "Mummy, where are the ducks?" they asked. </div><div class="paragraph">Ms. Schön's friend suggested that she bring the famous little birds to life. Mr. McCloskey himself was delighted with the idea.

His family was prosperous, and White was raised with the mix of sophistication and common sense that would mark his writing.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">After graduation from Cornell University, White spent a year as a newspaper reporter in New York City, then decided to drive across the country with a friend in a Model T Ford. The trip gave White a lifetime of anecdotes, and spawned a legend or two. "When they ran out of money," White 's friend, James Thurber, noted, "they played for their supper—and their gasoline—on a fascinating musical instrument that White had made out of some pieces of wire and an old shoe."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">When White returned to New York City in the mid-I920s, he spent a few years bouncing between advertising jobs and unemployment before trying his hand again at writing. Borrowing his brother's typewriter, he began pounding out sketches and poems. On a lark, he sent some essays to a fledgling magazine called <span class="stressed_text_2">The New Yorker</span>. Since its founding in 1925, the magazine had struggled to find its niche, and White's work helped put <span class="stressed_text_2">The New Yorker</span> on the map. His essays were funny and sophisticated; they spoke equally to socialites and cab drivers, professors and plumbers. Through his essays, which he wrote for nearly 50 years, White helped give <span class="stressed_text_2">The New Yorker</span> its voice and identity.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">In 1945, already a leading literary figure, White embarked on his second career: writing children's books. He moved from New York to a farm in Maine, where he raised chickens and geese. Seeking a way to amuse his nieces and nephews, White started to write stories for them. "Children were always after me to tell them a story and I found I couldn't do it," he said. "So I had to get it down on paper."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">A vivid dream about a mouselike character led to <span class="stressed_text_2">Stuart Little</span>. Then, in 1952, White published <span class="stressed_text_2">Charlotte's Web</span>. The book, which was inspired by White's own farm animals, is arguably the most famous children's story published in the 20th century.</div><div class="paragraph" align="center">Page 3</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="paragraph"><table style="border:1px solid black" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><div class="prose1"><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">By the time he died from Alzheimer's disease in 1985, White's essays had appeared in more college anthologies than those of any other writer.

We encountered better luck than we had bargained for.</span> The cow moose and her young one were standing near the wall of the deer park below the monkey house, and in order to get a better view we strolled down to the lower end of the park, by the brook. The path there is not much traveled. As we approached the corner where the brook trickles under the wire fence, we noticed a red deer getting to her feet. Beside her, on legs that were just learning their business, was a spotted fawn, as small and perfect as a trinket seen through a reducing glass. They stood there, mother and child, under a gray beech whose trunk was engraved with dozens of hearts and initials. Stretched on the ground was another fawn, and we realized that the doe had just finished twinning. The second fawn was still wet, still unrisen. Here was a scene of rare sylvan splendor, in one of our five favorite boroughs, and we couldn't have asked for more. Even our new shoes seemed to be working out all right and weren't hurting much.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The doe was only a couple of feet from the wire, and we sat down on a rock at the edge of the footpath to see what sort of start young fawns get in the deep fastnesses of Mittel Bronx.</div><div class="paragraph" align="center">Page 5</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="paragraph"><table style="border:1px solid black" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><div class="prose1"><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The mother, mildly resentful of our presence and dazed from her labor, raised one forefoot and stamped primly. Then she lowered her head, picked up the afterbirth, and began dutifully to eat it, allowing it to swing crazily from her mouth, as though it were a bunch of withered beet greens. From the monkey house came the loud, insane hooting of some captious primate, filling the whole woodland with a wild hooroar. As we watched, the sun broke weakly through, brightened the rich red of the fawns, and kindled their white spots. Occasionally, a sightseer would appear and wander aimlessly by, but of all who passed none was aware that anything extraordinary had occurred. "Looka the kangaroos!" a child cried. And he and his mother stared sullenly at the deer and then walked on.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">In a few moments the second twin gathered all his legs and all his ingenuity and arose, to stand for the first time sniffing the mysteries of a park for captive deer. The doe, in recognition of his achievement, quit her other work and began to dry him, running her tongue against the grain and paying particular attention to the key points. Meanwhile the first fawn tiptoed toward the shallow brook, in little stops and goes, and started across. He paused midstream to make a slight contribution, as a child does in bathing. Then, while his mother watched, he continued across, gained the other side, selected a hiding place, and lay down under a skunk-cabbage leaf next to the fence, in perfect concealment, his legs folded neatly under him. Without actually going out of sight, he had managed to disappear completely in the shifting light and shade. From somewhere a long way off a twelve-o'clock whistle sounded. We hung around awhile, but he never budged. Before we left, we crossed the brook ourself, just outside the fence, knelt, reached through the wire, and tested the truth of what we had once heard: that you can scratch a new fawn between the ears without starting him. You can indeed.</div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:80%"><div class="attrib">"TWINS" FROM THE SECOND TREE FROM THE CORNER</div><div class="attrib">by E. B. White. Copyright 1948 by E. B.

Beside her, on legs that were just learning their business, was a spotted fawn, as small and perfect as a trinket seen through a reducing glass. They stood there, mother and child, under a gray beech whose trunk was engraved with dozens of hearts and initials. Stretched on the ground was another fawn, and we realized that the doe had just finished twinning. The second fawn was still wet, still unrisen.

The path there is not much traveled. As we approached the corner where the brook trickles under the wire fence, we noticed a red deer getting to her feet. Beside her, on legs that were just learning their business, was a spotted fawn, as small and perfect as a trinket seen through a reducing glass. They stood there, mother and child, under a gray beech whose trunk was engraved with dozens of hearts and initials. Stretched on the ground was another fawn, and we realized that the doe had just finished twinning. The second fawn was still wet, still unrisen.

The path there is not much traveled. As we approached the corner where the brook trickles under the wire fence, we noticed a red deer getting to her feet. Beside her, on legs that were just learning their business, was a spotted fawn, as small and perfect as a trinket seen through a reducing glass. They stood there, mother and child, under a gray beech whose trunk was engraved with dozens of hearts and initials. Stretched on the ground was another fawn, and we realized that the doe had just finished twinning. The second fawn was still wet, still unrisen.

The path there is not much traveled. As we approached the corner where the brook trickles under the wire fence, we noticed a red deer getting to her feet. Beside her, on legs that were just learning their business, was a spotted fawn, as small and perfect as a trinket seen through a reducing glass. They stood there, mother and child, under a gray beech whose trunk was engraved with dozens of hearts and initials. Stretched on the ground was another fawn, and we realized that the doe had just finished twinning. The second fawn was still wet, still unrisen. Here was a scene of rare sylvan splendor, in one of our five favorite boroughs, and we couldn't have asked for more.

We encountered better luck than we had bargained for.</span> The cow moose and her young one were standing near the wall of the deer park below the monkey house, and in order to get a better view we strolled down to the lower end of the park, by the brook. The path there is not much traveled. As we approached the corner where the brook trickles under the wire fence, we noticed a red deer getting to her feet. Beside her, on legs that were just learning their business, was a spotted fawn, as small and perfect as a trinket seen through a reducing glass. They stood there, mother and child, under a gray beech whose trunk was engraved with dozens of hearts and initials. Stretched on the ground was another fawn, and we realized that the doe had just finished twinning. The second fawn was still wet, still unrisen. Here was a scene of rare sylvan splendor, in one of our five favorite boroughs, and we couldn't have asked for more. Even our new shoes seemed to be working out all right and weren't hurting much.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The doe was only a couple of feet from the wire, and we sat down on a rock at the edge of the footpath to see what sort of start young fawns get in the deep fastnesses of Mittel Bronx.</div><div class="paragraph" align="center">Page 5</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="paragraph"><table style="border:1px solid black" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><div class="prose1"><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The mother, mildly resentful of our presence and dazed from her labor, raised one forefoot and stamped primly. Then she lowered her head, picked up the afterbirth, and began dutifully to eat it, allowing it to swing crazily from her mouth, as though it were a bunch of withered beet greens. From the monkey house came the loud, insane hooting of some captious primate, filling the whole woodland with a wild hooroar. As we watched, the sun broke weakly through, brightened the rich red of the fawns, and kindled their white spots. Occasionally, a sightseer would appear and wander aimlessly by, but of all who passed none was aware that anything extraordinary had occurred. "Looka the kangaroos!" a child cried. And he and his mother stared sullenly at the deer and then walked on.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">In a few moments the second twin gathered all his legs and all his ingenuity and arose, to stand for the first time sniffing the mysteries of a park for captive deer. The doe, in recognition of his achievement, quit her other work and began to dry him, running her tongue against the grain and paying particular attention to the key points. Meanwhile the first fawn tiptoed toward the shallow brook, in little stops and goes, and started across. He paused midstream to make a slight contribution, as a child does in bathing. Then, while his mother watched, he continued across, gained the other side, selected a hiding place, and lay down under a skunk-cabbage leaf next to the fence, in perfect concealment, his legs folded neatly under him. Without actually going out of sight, he had managed to disappear completely in the shifting light and shade. From somewhere a long way off a twelve-o'clock whistle sounded. We hung around awhile, but he never budged. Before we left, we crossed the brook ourself, just outside the fence, knelt, reached through the wire, and tested the truth of what we had once heard: that you can scratch a new fawn between the ears without starting him. You can indeed.</div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:80%"><div class="attrib">"TWINS" FROM THE SECOND TREE FROM THE CORNER</div><div class="attrib">by E. B. White. Copyright 1948 by E. B.

In 1869, the Wyoming Territory gave women the vote, with the first permanent suffrage law in the nation. ("It made sense that a place like Wyoming would embrace women's rights," Gail Collins of <span class="stressed_text_2">The New York Times</span> wrote in her book <span class="stressed_text_2">America's Women</span>. "With very few women around, there was no danger that they could impose their will on the male majority.")</div><div class="paragraph">In 1878, a constitutional amendment was introduced in Congress. The legislation languished for nine years. In 1887, the full Senate considered the amendment for the first time and defeated it by about 2-to-1. </div><div class="paragraph">But the suffrage movement was slowly gaining support. With more and more women graduating from high school, going to college, and working outside the home, many Americans began asking: Why couldn't women vote too?</div></div></div><div class="prose1"><div class="paragraph" align="center">Page 3</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="paragraph"><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="800" align="center"><tbody><tr><td><div class="container"><div class="prose2 col2lt"><div class="paragraph">Plenty of opposition existed, according to Collins: Democrats feared women would vote for more socially progressive Republicans. The liquor industry, afraid of prohibition, also opposed women's suffrage, as did many people in the South, where blacks had been largely disenfranchised since Reconstruction.</div><div class="paragraph">In 1918, after much cajoling and picketing by suffragists, President Woodrow Wilson changed his mind and backed the amendment. The next year, both houses of Congress voted to amend the Constitution. Suffrage advocates predicted quick ratification by the states. (By 1919, 28 states permitted women to vote, at least for President.) Within a little more than a year, 35 of the required 36 states had voted for ratification.</div><div class="paragraph">The last stand for anti-suffragists was in Tennessee in the summer of 1920. Their showdown in the State Legislature became known as the "War of the Roses." (Pro-amendment forces sported yellow roses; the antis wore red.)</div><div class="paragraph">After two roll calls, the vote was still tied, 48-48. On the third, Harry T. Burn, a Republican and, at 24, the youngest member of the legislature. switched sides. He was wearing a red rose but voted for ratification because he had received a letter from his mother that read, in part: "Hurrah and vote for suffrage! Don't keep them in doubt!"</div></div><div class="prose2 col2rt"><div class="paragraph">Burn said later: "I know that a mother's advice is always safest for her boy to follow and my mother wanted me to vote for ratification. I appreciated the fact that an opportunity such as seldom comes to mortal man-to free 17,000,000 women from political slavery-was mine."</div><div class="paragraph">GRADUAL CHANGE</div><div class="paragraph">In 1920, women across America had the right to vote in a presidential election. (In the South, black women and men would be kept off voter rolls in large numbers until 1965, after passage of the Voting Rights Act.)</div><div class="paragraph">But newly enfranchised women voted in much smaller numbers than men. "Women who were adults at that time had been socialized to believe that voting was socially inappropriate for women," says Susan J. Carroll, senior scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics.</div><div class="paragraph">The political and social change sought by suffragists came gradually and not without fits and starts. An Equal Rights Amendment, stipulating equal treatment of the sexes under the law, was passed by Congress and sent to the states in 1972, but later failed after being ratified by only 35 of the necessary 38 states.</div><div class="paragraph">In 1980, however, women surpassed men for the first time in turnout for a presidential election.

Otherwise, she warned, "we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation."</div><div class="paragraph">That summer, the Declaration of Independence proclaimed that all men are created equal but said nothing of women's equality. It would take another </div></div><div class="prose2 col2rt"><div class="paragraph">144 years before the U.S. Constitution was amended, giving women the right to vote in every state.</div><div class="paragraph">That 19th Amendment says simply: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex." It took effect after a dramatic ratification battle in Tennessee in which a 24-year-old legislator cast the deciding vote.</div><div class="paragraph">The amendment was a long time coming.

(As far back as 1776, New Jersey allowed women property owners to vote, but rescinded that right three decades later.)</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">"WOMANIFESTO"</span></div><div class="paragraph">The campaign for women's rights began in earnest in 1848 at a Women's Rights convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y., organized by 32-year-old Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other advocates. Stanton had drafted a "Womanifesto" patterned on the Declaration of Independence, but the one resolution that shocked even some of her supporters was a demand for equal voting rights, also known as universal suffrage. "I saw clearly," Stanton later recalled, "that the power to make the laws was the right through which all other rights could be secured."</div><div class="paragraph">Stanton was joined in her campaign by Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth, Lucretia Mott, and other crusaders who would become icons of the women's movement. Some were militant. Many were met with verbal abuse and even violence.

In 1869, the Wyoming Territory gave women the vote, with the first permanent suffrage law in the nation. ("It made sense that a place like Wyoming would embrace women's rights," Gail Collins of <span class="stressed_text_2">The New York Times</span> wrote in her book <span class="stressed_text_2">America's Women</span>. "With very few women around, there was no danger that they could impose their will on the male majority.")</div><div class="paragraph">In 1878, a constitutional amendment was introduced in Congress. The legislation languished for nine years. In 1887, the full Senate considered the amendment for the first time and defeated it by about 2-to-1. </div><div class="paragraph">But the suffrage movement was slowly gaining support. With more and more women graduating from high school, going to college, and working outside the home, many Americans began asking: Why couldn't women vote too?</div></div></div><div class="prose1"><div class="paragraph" align="center">Page 3</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="paragraph"><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="800" align="center"><tbody><tr><td><div class="container"><div class="prose2 col2lt"><div class="paragraph">Plenty of opposition existed, according to Collins: Democrats feared women would vote for more socially progressive Republicans. The liquor industry, afraid of prohibition, also opposed women's suffrage, as did many people in the South, where blacks had been largely disenfranchised since Reconstruction.</div><div class="paragraph">In 1918, after much cajoling and picketing by suffragists, President Woodrow Wilson changed his mind and backed the amendment. The next year, both houses of Congress voted to amend the Constitution. Suffrage advocates predicted quick ratification by the states. (By 1919, 28 states permitted women to vote, at least for President.) Within a little more than a year, 35 of the required 36 states had voted for ratification.</div><div class="paragraph">The last stand for anti-suffragists was in Tennessee in the summer of 1920. Their showdown in the State Legislature became known as the "War of the Roses." (Pro-amendment forces sported yellow roses; the antis wore red.)</div><div class="paragraph">After two roll calls, the vote was still tied, 48-48. On the third, Harry T. Burn, a Republican and, at 24, the youngest member of the legislature. switched sides. He was wearing a red rose but voted for ratification because he had received a letter from his mother that read, in part: "Hurrah and vote for suffrage! Don't keep them in doubt!"</div></div><div class="prose2 col2rt"><div class="paragraph">Burn said later: "I know that a mother's advice is always safest for her boy to follow and my mother wanted me to vote for ratification. I appreciated the fact that an opportunity such as seldom comes to mortal man-to free 17,000,000 women from political slavery-was mine."</div><div class="paragraph">GRADUAL CHANGE</div><div class="paragraph">In 1920, women across America had the right to vote in a presidential election. (In the South, black women and men would be kept off voter rolls in large numbers until 1965, after passage of the Voting Rights Act.)</div><div class="paragraph">But newly enfranchised women voted in much smaller numbers than men. "Women who were adults at that time had been socialized to believe that voting was socially inappropriate for women," says Susan J. Carroll, senior scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics.</div><div class="paragraph">The political and social change sought by suffragists came gradually and not without fits and starts. An Equal Rights Amendment, stipulating equal treatment of the sexes under the law, was passed by Congress and sent to the states in 1972, but later failed after being ratified by only 35 of the necessary 38 states.</div><div class="paragraph">In 1980, however, women surpassed men for the first time in turnout for a presidential election. Since then, there has also been a substantial rise in the number of women running for and holding political office. </div><div class="attrib">VC176436</div><div class="attrib">From <span class="stressed_text_2">THE NEW YORK TIMES UPFRONT</span></div><div class="attrib">magazine, September 5, 2005 issue. </div><div class="attrib">Copyright © 2005 by Scholastic Inc and The New York Times Company.

Each year, we throw away 12 million computers. And that is not good news for the environment. To make our gadgets work, many of them use materials like lead and mercury. When mercury and lead end up in a landfill, they spread poisons into the earth, water, and air for miles around.

That's why some seventh-grade students at a school in Michigan organized a computer drop-off event.

They dropped off dozens of old computers, </div></div><div class="prose2 col2rt"><div class="paragraph">monitors, and printers at the school. Craig Greshaw, the school's computer teacher who helped organize the event, believes that knowing about computers goes beyond surfing the Web. "Part of that is learning about the chemicals inside the computers and what needs to be done with them to keep them safe," he told the town newspaper during the recycling drive. With their school gym filled with old computers, the students were ready for the next step in cleaning up the high-tech trash: turning old computers into new ones.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">That's where companies like RePC step in. The Seattle company takes e-waste and turns it into e-gold. "Almost all of the parts of a computer can be reused or recycled," says Mark Dabek, owner of RePC. Any computer parts that can't be reused or sold get recycled in a way that won't hurt the environment.

Places like schools and community centers are often short on cash, but need computers to help them get things done. Robert Sterling, a computer teacher at a high school in California, uses computers donated from local businesses to motivate students and teach them about recycling. "If kids learn to recycle everything," says Sterling, "they will set a good example for some of the older people who are not in the habit yet of recycling every day."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Recycling old computers is big business, and there are many other companies like RePC across the country. Many big charities have computer-recycling </div></div><div class="prose2 col2rt"><div class="paragraph">programs too, but be sure to call them first before you drop off any equipment.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Computers aren't the only technology that can be reused. Last year, schools in New Mexico gave old cell phones a new lease on life while also helping to raise money for charity. The students collected eleven garbage bags of old cell phones, sold them to a cell phone refurbishing company, donated the money to charity, and helped keep the environment clean—all at the same time.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">Building a Greener Future</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Some computer makers are tackling tech trash by designing more environmentally responsible products.

"Just what I need to make a nice turkey stuffing," Ma had said when Willy arrived home with them a few days back. He was glad she hadn't asked where he'd found the chestnuts. It was a story he wasn't anxious to tell...</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">Willy had taken a shortcut through the forest, hoping to practice some tracking skills. Be sure to mark your trail, Pa always said, so he'd been slicing curls of bark from tree trunks. The fresh blazes glowed white in the gloom of the forest. No fear of missing those on the way back, Willy thought, folding down the blade of his jackknife. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">He had just started to search the ground for animal tracks when a squirrel bounded across his path. For a frozen moment it stared up at him, and Willy noticed its bulging cheeks. "I'll bet you've got a cache of nuts somewhere, you little rascal." </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">The squirrel darted away, and Willy ran after it. Deeper and deeper he plunged into the forest, his eyes on the flicker of tail before him. Then, with a sudden leap, the squirrel scampered up a tree and vanished. Willy collapsed against the tree trunk, panting. Lost him! </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">Peering around, he felt the darkness of the forest press down on him. No white blazes pointed the way back. With a stab of alarm he realized he'd completely forgotten Pa's warning. What will I do? Willy slumped onto a large gnarled root. Shout? No use. Too far from home.Perhaps someone will come along. He listened hard. Nothing but eerie silence. Don't panic, he told himself. Don't panic. But he'd heard about people being lost in the woods for days, sometimes even...forever. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">A rustle of leaves made him glance around. The squirrel! They stared at each other, unblinking, for a second. Then, with a flip of its tail, the squirrel disappeared under a twisted root. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">"I'll bet that's your hiding place." Willy was about to thrust his hand into the hole when he thought about the squirrel's sharp teeth. Instead he picked up a short stick. No angry scolding followed his probing, so he reached in. It was a cache of beechnuts. He could feel their three-sided shapes. And what was that? Something bigger. He drew out a handful. There, among the small, shiny beechnuts was one big chestnut. If there's one, there must be more. He felt around again. Yes, more big ones. Just what Ma needs for the turkey stuffing. Then he remembered— home. How was he going to find his way home? </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">There must be a way out. He peered into the darkness, hoping for any sign of the way he had come. Nothing. No—wait. A memory tugged at the back of his mind—just before the squirrel disappeared, his hand had brushed against smooth bark. Most of these trees had rough bark. But what if... Searching carefully, Willy spotted a smooth-barked tree. Underneath it on the forest floor were scuffled leaves. And there! Leading away was a line of scuffs. Leaves crunched by feet. Were these his own footprints? Yes! He could follow them back to the path. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">"Hooray!" Willy shouted. Then he remembered the nuts. I'll come back for them. But, no, on second thought he didn't really want to come here again. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">He pulled off his shirt, shivering in the chilly October air. It would make a good carrying sack. He'd run to keep himself warm. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">He'd cleared the squirrel's hole right down to the bottom and was tying the shirt sleeves together to close the sack when a thought struck him. Opening the bulging shirt, he scooped out a handful of beechnuts and dropped them back into the hole. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;"> "There," he said, in the general direction of the squirrel. "Now you can enjoy your harvest dinner, too."</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div><table width="500px"><tbody><tr><td><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:9pt; padding-left:70px">From <span class="stressed_text_2">A Pioneer Thanksgiving</span>, written by Barbara Greenwood and illustrated by Heather Collins.

"Just what I need to make a nice turkey stuffing," Ma had said when Willy arrived home with them a few days back. He was glad she hadn't asked where he'd found the chestnuts. It was a story he wasn't anxious to tell...</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">Willy had taken a shortcut through the forest, hoping to practice some tracking skills. Be sure to mark your trail, Pa always said, so he'd been slicing curls of bark from tree trunks. The fresh blazes glowed white in the gloom of the forest. No fear of missing those on the way back, Willy thought, folding down the blade of his jackknife. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">He had just started to search the ground for animal tracks when a squirrel bounded across his path. For a frozen moment it stared up at him, and Willy noticed its bulging cheeks. "I'll bet you've got a cache of nuts somewhere, you little rascal." </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">The squirrel darted away, and Willy ran after it. Deeper and deeper he plunged into the forest, his eyes on the flicker of tail before him. Then, with a sudden leap, the squirrel scampered up a tree and vanished. Willy collapsed against the tree trunk, panting. Lost him! </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">Peering around, he felt the darkness of the forest press down on him. No white blazes pointed the way back. With a stab of alarm he realized he'd completely forgotten Pa's warning. What will I do? Willy slumped onto a large gnarled root. Shout? No use. Too far from home.Perhaps someone will come along. He listened hard. Nothing but eerie silence. Don't panic, he told himself. Don't panic. But he'd heard about people being lost in the woods for days, sometimes even...forever. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">A rustle of leaves made him glance around. The squirrel! They stared at each other, unblinking, for a second. Then, with a flip of its tail, the squirrel disappeared under a twisted root. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">"I'll bet that's your hiding place." Willy was about to thrust his hand into the hole when he thought about the squirrel's sharp teeth. Instead he picked up a short stick. No angry scolding followed his probing, so he reached in. It was a cache of beechnuts. He could feel their three-sided shapes. And what was that? Something bigger. He drew out a handful. There, among the small, shiny beechnuts was one big chestnut. If there's one, there must be more. He felt around again. Yes, more big ones. Just what Ma needs for the turkey stuffing. Then he remembered— home. How was he going to find his way home? </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">There must be a way out. He peered into the darkness, hoping for any sign of the way he had come. Nothing. No—wait. A memory tugged at the back of his mind—just before the squirrel disappeared, his hand had brushed against smooth bark. Most of these trees had rough bark. But what if... Searching carefully, Willy spotted a smooth-barked tree. Underneath it on the forest floor were scuffled leaves. And there! Leading away was a line of scuffs. Leaves crunched by feet. Were these his own footprints? Yes! He could follow them back to the path. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">"Hooray!" Willy shouted. Then he remembered the nuts. I'll come back for them. But, no, on second thought he didn't really want to come here again. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">He pulled off his shirt, shivering in the chilly October air. It would make a good carrying sack. He'd run to keep himself warm. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">He'd cleared the squirrel's hole right down to the bottom and was tying the shirt sleeves together to close the sack when a thought struck him. Opening the bulging shirt, he scooped out a handful of beechnuts and dropped them back into the hole. </div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;"> "There," he said, in the general direction of the squirrel. "Now you can enjoy your harvest dinner, too."</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div><table width="500px"><tbody><tr><td><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:9pt; padding-left:70px">From <span class="stressed_text_2">A Pioneer Thanksgiving</span>, written by Barbara Greenwood and illustrated by Heather Collins.

"I decided to try to find planets orbiting other stars like our Sun."</div><div class="paragraph">And he did. "My research partner, Paul Butler, and I found our first planet in 1995," Dr. Marcy says. "We worked for ten years without finding anything! But we stuck with it, and our patience paid off."</div><div class="paragraph">Since then, the two scientists have detected 65 of the more than 100 planets found orbiting other stars. These worlds are called <span class="stressed_text_2">extrasolar planets.</span> Dr. Marcy and Dr. Butler also spotted the first "family" of three planets. In June 2002 they announced another discovery: a Jupiter-like planet orbiting star number 55 in the constellation Cancer.

I could see the rings around it!" says Marcy. Soon he was hooked on becoming an astronomer.</div><div class="paragraph">But learning astronomy wasn't easy. Marcy worried that he wasn't smart enough. He decided that if he was going to continue in astronomy, he had to study something he really cared about.</div><div class="paragraph">"What excited me most was whether there were planets in other solar systems where life might flourish," he says. "I decided to try to find planets orbiting other stars like our Sun."</div><div class="paragraph">And he did. "My research partner, Paul Butler, and I found our first planet in 1995," Dr. Marcy says. "We worked for ten years without finding anything! But we stuck with it, and our patience paid off."</div><div class="paragraph">Since then, the two scientists have detected 65 of the more than 100 planets found orbiting other stars. These worlds are called <span class="stressed_text_2">extrasolar planets.</span> Dr. Marcy and Dr. Butler also spotted the first "family" of three planets. In June 2002 they announced another discovery: a Jupiter-like planet orbiting star number 55 in the constellation Cancer. This star is called 55 Cancri.</div><div class="paragraph">At first, the research partners found only planets that orbit close to stars.

The planet orbiting 55 Cancri is a major breakthrough: it's the first sighting of a large gas planet about the same distance from the star as Jupiter is from the Sun.</div><div class="paragraph">Why is this important? Scientists think that life on Earth may exist because of two special features in our solar system. The first is Jupiter.</div><div class="paragraph">"Because it's so big, Jupiter is a cosmic vacuum cleaner, sucking up comets and asteroids," Dr. Marcy explains. "Without Jupiter, impacts would likely have destroyed life on Earth."</div><div class="paragraph">A second feature is that Earth is a rocky planet in the <span class="stressed_text_2">habitable zone.</span> This zone is an area where liquid water, which is essential for life, can exist.

H. Munro) (1870–1916)</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center"><div class="stdaln_img"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(29)" alt="Image of a small ornamental design." title="Image of a small ornamental design." height="86" width="67" class="inln_img"></div></div><div class="paragraph"></div></div></td></tr><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"My aunt will be down presently, Mr. Nuttel," said a very self-possessed young lady of fifteen; "in the meantime you must try and put up with me."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">Framton Nuttel endeavored to say the correct something which should duly flatter the niece of the moment without unduly discounting the aunt that was to come. Privately he doubted more than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of total strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure which he was supposed to be undergoing.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"I know how it will be," his sister had said when he was preparing to migrate to this rural retreat; "you will bury yourself down there and not speak to a living soul, and your nerves will be worse than ever from moping. I shall just give you letters of introduction to all the people I know there. Some of them, as far as I can remember, were quite nice."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">Framton wondered whether Mrs. Sappleton, the lady to whom he was presenting one of the letters of introduction, came into the nice division.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Do you know many of the people round here?" asked the niece, when she judged that they had had sufficient silent communion.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Hardly a soul," said Framton. "My sister was staying here, at the rectory, you know, some four years ago, and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the people here."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">He made the last statement in a tone of distinct regret.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Then you know practically nothing about my aunt?" pursued the self-possessed young lady.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Only her name and address," admitted the caller. He was wondering whether Mrs. Sappleton was in the married or widowed state. An undefinable something about the room seemed to suggest masculine habitation.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Her great tragedy happened just three years ago," said the child; "that would be since your sister's time."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Her tragedy?" asked Framton; somehow in this restful country spot tragedies seemed out of place.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an October afternoon," said the niece, indicating a large French window that opened onto a lawn.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"It is quite warm for the time of the year," said Framton; "but has that window got anything to do with the tragedy?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Out through that window, three years ago to a day, her husband and her two young brothers went off for their day's shooting. They never came back. In crossing the moor to their favorite snipe-shooting ground they were all three engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog. It had been that dreadful wet summer, you know, and places that were safe in other years gave way suddenly without warning. Their bodies were never recovered. That was the dreadful part of it." Here the child's voice lost its self-possessed note and became falteringly human. "Poor aunt always thinks that they will come back someday, they and the little brown spaniel that was lost with them, and walk in at that window just as they used to do. That is why the window is kept open every evening till it is quite dusk. Poor dear aunt, she has often told me how they went out, her husband with his white waterproof coat over his arm, and Ronnie, her youngest brother, singing, 'Bertie, why do you bound?' as he always did to tease her, because she said it got on her nerves. Do you know, sometimes on still, quiet evenings like this, I almost get a creepy feeling that they will all walk in through that window—"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">She broke off with a little shudder. It was a relief to Framton when the aunt bustled into the room with a whirl of apologies for being late in making her appearance.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"I hope Vera has been amusing you?" she said.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"She has been very interesting," said Framton.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"I hope you don't mind the open window," said Mrs. Sappleton briskly; "my husband and brothers will be home directly from shooting, and they always come in this way. They've been out for snipe in the marshes today, so they'll make a fine mess over my poor carpets. So like you menfolk, isn't it?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">She rattled on cheerfully about the shooting and the scarcity of birds, and the prospects for duck in the winter. To Framton it was all purely horrible. He made a desperate but only partially successful effort to turn the talk onto a less ghastly topic; he was conscious that his hostess was giving him only a fragment of her attention, and her eyes were constantly straying past him to the open window and the lawn beyond. It was certainly an unfortunate coincidence that he should have paid his visit on this tragic anniversary.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest, an absence of mental excitement, and avoidance of anything in the nature of violent physical exercise," announced Framton, who labored under the tolerably widespread delusion that total strangers and chance acquaintances are hungry for the least detail of one's ailments and infirmities, their cause and cure. "On the matter of diet they are not so much in agreement," he continued.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"No?" said Mrs. Sappleton, in a voice which only replaced a yawn at the last moment. Then she suddenly brightened into alert attention-but not to what Framton was saying.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Here they are at last!" she cried. "Just in time for tea, and don't they look as if they were muddy up to the eyes!"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">Framton shivered slightly and turned towards the niece with a look intended to convey sympathetic comprehension. The child was staring out through the open window with a dazed horror in her eyes. In a chill shock of nameless fear Framton swung round in his seat and looked in the same direction.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">In the deepening twilight three figures were walking across the lawn towards the window; they all carried guns under their arms, and one of them was additionally burdened with a white coat hung over his shoulders. A tired brown spaniel kept close at their heels. Noiselessly they neared the house, and then a hoarse young voice chanted out of the dusk: "I said, Bertie, why do you bound?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">Framton grabbed wildly at his stick and hat; the hall door, the gravel drive, and the front gate were dimly noted stages in his headlong retreat. A cyclist coming along the road had to run into the hedge to avoid imminent collision.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Here we are, my dear," said the bearer of the white mackintosh, coming in through the window; "fairly muddy, but most of it's dry. Who was that who bolted out as we came up?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"A most extraordinary man, a Mr. Nuttel," said Mrs. Sappleton; "could only talk about his illnesses, and dashed off without a word of goodbye or apology when you arrived. One would think he had seen a ghost."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"I expect it was the spaniel," said the niece calmly; "he told me he had a horror of dogs. He was once hunted into a cemetery somewhere on the banks of the Ganges by a pack of pariah dogs, and had to spend the night in a newly dug grave with the creatures snarling and grinning and foaming just above him. Enough to make anyone lose their nerve."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">Romance at short notice was her specialty.</div></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br>153. <div class="paragraph">Which of the following best describes what happens in the story?</div></div><div class="distractors"><div>A. <span class="itemtext"><span>A young man visits his aunt and tells her about a recent tragedy.</span></span></div>

Privately he doubted more than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of total strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure which he was supposed to be undergoing.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"I know how it will be," his sister had said when he was preparing to migrate to this rural retreat; "you will bury yourself down there and not speak to a living soul, and your nerves will be worse than ever from moping.

"My sister was staying here, at the rectory, you know, some four years ago, and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the people here."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">He made the last statement in a tone of distinct regret.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Then you know practically nothing about my aunt?" pursued the self-possessed young lady.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Only her name and address," admitted the caller. He was wondering whether Mrs. Sappleton was in the married or widowed state. An undefinable something about the room seemed to suggest masculine habitation.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Her great tragedy happened just three years ago," said the child; "that would be since your sister's time."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Her tragedy?" asked Framton; somehow in this restful country spot tragedies seemed out of place.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an October afternoon," said the niece, indicating a large French window that opened onto a lawn.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"It is quite warm for the time of the year," said Framton; "but has that window got anything to do with the tragedy?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Out through that window, three years ago to a day, her husband and her two young brothers went off for their day's shooting. They never came back. In crossing the moor to their favorite snipe-shooting ground they were all three engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog. It had been that dreadful wet summer, you know, and places that were safe in other years gave way suddenly without warning. Their bodies were never recovered. That was the dreadful part of it." Here the child's voice lost its self-possessed note and became falteringly human. "Poor aunt always thinks that they will come back someday, they and the little brown spaniel that was lost with them, and walk in at that window just as they used to do. That is why the window is kept open every evening till it is quite dusk. Poor dear aunt, she has often told me how they went out, her husband with his white waterproof coat over his arm, and Ronnie, her youngest brother, singing, 'Bertie, why do you bound?' as he always did to tease her, because she said it got on her nerves. Do you know, sometimes on still, quiet evenings like this, I almost get a creepy feeling that they will all walk in through that window—"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">She broke off with a little shudder. It was a relief to Framton when the aunt bustled into the room with a whirl of apologies for being late in making her appearance.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"I hope Vera has been amusing you?" she said.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"She has been very interesting," said Framton.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"I hope you don't mind the open window," said Mrs. Sappleton briskly; "my husband and brothers will be home directly from shooting, and they always come in this way.

So like you menfolk, isn't it?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">She rattled on cheerfully about the shooting and the scarcity of birds, and the prospects for duck in the winter. To Framton it was all purely horrible. He made a desperate but only partially successful effort to turn the talk onto a less ghastly topic; he was conscious that his hostess was giving him only a fragment of her attention, and her eyes were constantly straying past him to the open window and the lawn beyond. It was certainly an unfortunate coincidence that he should have paid his visit on this tragic anniversary.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest, an absence of mental excitement, and avoidance of anything in the nature of violent physical exercise," announced Framton, who labored under the tolerably widespread delusion that total strangers and chance acquaintances are hungry for the least detail of one's ailments and infirmities, their cause and cure. "On the matter of diet they are not so much in agreement," he continued.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"No?" said Mrs. Sappleton, in a voice which only replaced a yawn at the last moment. Then she suddenly brightened into alert attention-but not to what Framton was saying.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Here they are at last!" she cried. "Just in time for tea, and don't they look as if they were muddy up to the eyes!"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">Framton shivered slightly and turned towards the niece with a look intended to convey sympathetic comprehension. The child was staring out through the open window with a dazed horror in her eyes. In a chill shock of nameless fear Framton swung round in his seat and looked in the same direction.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">In the deepening twilight three figures were walking across the lawn towards the window; they all carried guns under their arms, and one of them was additionally burdened with a white coat hung over his shoulders. A tired brown spaniel kept close at their heels. Noiselessly they neared the house, and then a hoarse young voice chanted out of the dusk: "I said, Bertie, why do you bound?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">Framton grabbed wildly at his stick and hat; the hall door, the gravel drive, and the front gate were dimly noted stages in his headlong retreat. A cyclist coming along the road had to run into the hedge to avoid imminent collision.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"Here we are, my dear," said the bearer of the white mackintosh, coming in through the window; "fairly muddy, but most of it's dry. Who was that who bolted out as we came up?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"A most extraordinary man, a Mr. Nuttel," said Mrs. Sappleton; "could only talk about his illnesses, and dashed off without a word of goodbye or apology when you arrived. One would think he had seen a ghost."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px; padding-right:20px;">"I expect it was the spaniel," said the niece calmly; "he told me he had a horror of dogs. He was once hunted into a cemetery somewhere on the banks of the Ganges by a pack of pariah dogs, and had to spend the night in a newly dug grave with the creatures snarling and grinning and foaming just above him.

Gates (1955- ) was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. His interest in computers, which began at the age of thirteen, led Gates to realize the potential of a standard operating platform for the computer era, and through the success of his company Microsoft, he became one of the world's richest men. Criticized for its monopolistic practices, Microsoft was sued by the United States government in the 1990's. In 2000, Gates established the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has become the world's largest philanthropy dedicated to improving health and education worldwide. The following essay was published in 1999.</div></div><div class="prose1"><div class="paragraph">Human beings are not the biggest animals. We're not the strongest or fastest. We're not the sharpest in sight or smell It's amazing how we survived against the many fierce creatures of nature. We survived and prospered because of our brains. We evolved to fill the cognitive niche. We learned how to use tools, to build shelter, to invent agriculture, to domesticate livestock, to develop civilization and culture, to cure and prevent disease. Our tools and technologies have helped us to shape the environment around us.</div><div class="paragraph">I'm an optimist. I believe in progress. I'd much rather be alive today than at any time in history—and not just because in an earlier age my skill set wouldn't have been as valuable and I'd have been a prime candidate for some beast's dinner. The tools of the Industrial Age extended the capabilities of our muscles. The tools of the digital age extend the capabilities of our minds. I'm even happier for my children, who will come of age in this new world.</div></div><div class="prose1"><div class="paragraph">Page 1</div></div><div class="prose1"><div class="paragraph">By embracing the digital age, we can accelerate the positive effects and mitigate the challenges, such as privacy and have-vs.-have-not. If we sit back and wait for the digital age to come to us on terms defined by others, we won't be able to do either. The Web lifestyle can increase citizen involvement in government. Many of the decisions to be made are political and social, not technical. These include how we ensure access for everyone and how we protect children. Citizens in every culture must engage on the social and political impact of digital technology to ensure that the new digital age reflects the society they want to create.</div><div class="paragraph">If we are reactive and let change overwhelm us or pass us by, we will perceive change negatively. If we are proactive, seek to understand the future now, and embrace change, the idea of the unexpected can be positive and uplifting. Astronomer Carl Sagan in his last book, <span class="stressed_text_2">Billions and Billions,</span> said: "The prediction I can make with the highest confidence is that the most amazing discoveries will be the ones we are not today wise enough to foresee."</div><div class="stdaln_img"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(30)" alt="Image shows a gloved hand holding a a rectangle approximately 3 inches by 5 inches, covered with a shiny material with a regular grid of perforations.

We're going to get improved products and services, more responsiveness to complaints, lower costs, and more choices. We're going to get better government and social services at substantially less expense.</div><div class="paragraph">This world is coming. A big part of it comes through businesses using a digital nervous system to radically improve their processes.</div><div class="paragraph">A digital nervous system can help business redefine itself and its role in the future, but energy or paralysis, success or failure, depends on business leaders. Only you can prepare your organization and make the investments necessary to capitalize on the rapidly dawning digital age.</div><div class="paragraph">Digital tools magnify the abilities that make us unique in the world: the ability to think, the ability to articulate our thoughts, the ability to work together to act on those thoughts. I strongly believe that if companies empower their employees to solve problems and give them potent tools to do this with, they will always be amazed at how much creativity and initiative will blossom forth.</div></div><div class="prose1"><div class="attrib">From BUSINESS @ THE SPEED OF THOUGHT</div><div class="attrib">by William Gates.

The rows of apartment buildings and the streets full of cars looked all the same. And it was cold.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Rosa missed her country. She had begun to learn some English, but she did not know what to say or what to do when other kids were around. They were friendly, but Rosa felt safer being alone.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Behind Rosa's brick apartment building was a special place, a small creek where Rosa always stopped after school. There were ducks there, and she could speak to them in her language. The ducks seemed to understand.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Every afternoon Rosa sat on a concrete slab above the creek and watched the ducks until Mama came home from work.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Rosa did not feed them. She knew that most people food was not right for ducks. But she watched them swim and feed and walk up to her, quacking. Once they even walked over Rosa's tummy as she lay with her feet stretched out on the bumpy grass. They like me, Rosa said to herself.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">One day after school, the ducks were not in the water. They did not waddle toward Rosa, even though she stayed very still. Something was wrong.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Gently, Rosa tiptoed to where the ducks were huddled. "Are you sick?" she whispered. They looked different. They looked greasy.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Then Rosa noticed the creek. An oily film covered it, making patches of color on the water's surface. She looked closely at the ducks. Their feathers were stuck together. They could not swim. They could not fly.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">I must get help, said Rosa to herself. But how? I don't know anyone. Mama told me not to speak to strangers. Besides, I don't know how to ask in English.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Rosa had an idea. She rushed back to the street, walked to the traffic light, then raced around the corner and back to the school yard.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Rosa was in luck. Boys and girls were still there practicing baseball with the gym teacher. Rosa had never played baseball in this country.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Please! Come!" said Rosa, breathless, "Ducks!"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Hello, Rosa," said the teacher. "What's the trouble?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Ducks!" said Rosa again. It was one of the few English words she was sure of. "Come. Please. Ducks!"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">She pointed in the direction of the creek. The kids were staring at her, but she didn't care. "Ducks!" she said again, her dark eyes pleading.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The teacher said something in English to his team. They looked as Rosa and talked all at once. Then the teacher smiled. "OK, Rosa," he said. "Show us." They all grabbed their baseball mitts and bats, and followed Rosa to the creek.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Pretty soon there were more people at Rosa's creek than she had ever seen there before. First the police came with their squad cars and sirens. Then came the firefighters with their big trucks and Humane Society workers in their vans.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">People came out from the apartment building with dishpans and towels and liquid dish detergent. Rosa did not understand all the talk, but she knew what was happening.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The ducks were too weak to fly or run away. She and the other kids rounded them up and held them in the dishpans while the Humane Society people worked. Four washes for each duck with mild detergent, and four rinses with clear water. It reminded Rosa of doing the wash.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">After a while someone brought a blow-dryer. Rosa laughed as the ducks were blown fluffy-dry. One by one, they were packed carefully into cages in the Humane Society vans.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"We'll keep them for a few days," one of the workers said. "They need time to regain the natural oils in their feathers, so they can keep themselves warm and swim properly. A big factory upstream spilled four hundred gallons of diesel fuel into the storm sewers last night. What a mess! You got to these ducks just in time, young lady."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Rosa did not know what the man was saying, but she saw how everyone smiled at her, and she felt proud.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">By the time Rosa's mama came home, the cars and the vans and the people were gone. Rosa was in her special place by the creek. But she was not alone. She was playing baseball with three friends. Rosa was good at baseball. She was getting better at English, too.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Home run!" she shouted, laughing, after she slugged the ball almost to the parking lot. Rosa was happy.

They were friendly, but Rosa felt safer being alone.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Behind Rosa's brick apartment building was a special place, a small creek where Rosa always stopped after school.

They like me, Rosa said to herself.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">One day after school, the ducks were not in the water.

She rushed back to the street, walked to the traffic light, then raced around the corner and back to the school yard.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Rosa was in luck.

Come!" said Rosa, breathless, "Ducks!"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Hello, Rosa," said the teacher. "What's the trouble?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Ducks!" said Rosa again. It was one of the few English words she was sure of. "Come. Please. Ducks!"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">She pointed in the direction of the creek. The kids were staring at her, but she didn't care. "Ducks!" she said again, her dark eyes pleading.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The teacher said something in English to his team. They looked as Rosa and talked all at once.

Rosa did not understand all the talk, but she knew what was happening.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The ducks were too weak to fly or run away. She and the other kids rounded them up and held them in the dishpans while the Humane Society people worked. Four washes for each duck with mild detergent, and four rinses with clear water. It reminded Rosa of doing the wash.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">After a while someone brought a blow-dryer. Rosa laughed as the ducks were blown fluffy-dry. One by one, they were packed carefully into cages in the Humane Society vans.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"We'll keep them for a few days," one of the workers said. "They need time to regain the natural oils in their feathers, so they can keep themselves warm and swim properly.

Rosa was in her special place by the creek. But she was not alone. She was playing baseball with three friends. Rosa was good at baseball.

The needle clicked over to the four-minute mark. Ellie stared at her watch while her mom watched the meter. Less than three minutes later, all of the time had expired. There it was: proof that they'd been cheated. The city tore up the ticket when Ellie's mom complained about the meter.</div><div class="paragraph">But the experience left Ellie wondering how many other meters were inaccurate. Six months later, she decided to find out. She'd been looking around for a good science-fair project—and that meter in Berkeley still bothered her. So armed with a bag of nickels and a stopwatch, she hit the streets.</div><div class="paragraph">Ellie didn't have the time or money to test every meter, so she focused on a sample of 50 meters located in different parts of the city. To avoid inconveniencing motorists, she did her research after 6 P.M. and on Sundays, when the meters were not in use. She put in eight minutes' worth of nickels in each meter, then measured how much time it really gave.</div><div class="paragraph">The results were not pretty. Ellie's findings suggested that more than nine out of every ten meters in the city were inaccurate—and that every fourth parking meter was running out of time too quickly. With 3,600 parking meters in the city, that meant a lot of undeserved tickets. As Ellie wrote in her science-project report, "I learned which meters cheat you and which meters cheat the City of Berkeley. But I learned that almost all meters cheat someone, so beware."</div><div class="paragraph">When the science fair rolled around, Ellie presented her findings with computer-generated charts and graphs. Her classmates weren't very interested in her project. "It's not like they have to drive a car or put money in a parking meter," she explains. But her project was a huge hit with parents. More than 50 of them lined up that night to share their own parking-meter horror stories with Ellie.</div><div class="paragraph">After that, word about Ellie's meter project spread fast. Within a few weeks, Ellie got a call from local politician Diane Woolley. At the time, Berkeley was considering replacing its meters with more accurate digital ones. Ellie shared her findings at city hall, and the politicians were impressed. "We don't get reports this thorough when we pay consultants hundreds of thousands of dollars," one remarked. Based on Ellie's study, they decided to purchase 2,000 new meters.</div><div class="paragraph">The California state legislature also decided to crack down on cheater meters. After Ellie presented her findings, they enacted "Lammer's Law," which requires California's 26 counties to test the accuracy of parking meters. Any meter found to be inaccurate must be fixed or dismantled.</div><div class="paragraph">California Governor Pete Wilson signed the law on November 1, 1998. At the time, he commented, "Ellie's ingenuity and dedication has earned her the gratitude of those Californians who've dug through their purses and pockets in search of exact change to feed the meters, only to return to find their cars bearing the dreaded green envelope of a parking ticket."</div><div class="paragraph">Ellie became a celebrity. She was in newspapers all over the country and featured on local television news during the summer and fall of 1998. CNN did a story about her. She was even a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman. "It was kind of a weird moment of being a celebrity," she says.</div><div class="paragraph">Ellie, who's now an eighth-grader at Martin Luther King Middle School, is proud of the work she's done.

That was in the fall of 1997. Ellie was 11 years old at the time, and she was getting her tresses trimmed in her hometown of Berkeley, California. When Ellie and her mom returned to their car, they found a parking ticket stuck to the windshield. It didn't seem possible: Less than an hour earlier, Ellie had pumped an hour's worth of coins into the meter. But now the needle was at zero, and Ellie's mom owed $20.</div><div class="paragraph">Feeling cheated, Ellie dropped another nickel in the meter and twisted the knob. The needle clicked over to the four-minute mark. Ellie stared at her watch while her mom watched the meter. Less than three minutes later, all of the time had expired. There it was: proof that they'd been cheated. The city tore up the ticket when Ellie's mom complained about the meter.</div><div class="paragraph">But the experience left Ellie wondering how many other meters were inaccurate. Six months later, she decided to find out. She'd been looking around for a good science-fair project—and that meter in Berkeley still bothered her. So armed with a bag of nickels and a stopwatch, she hit the streets.</div><div class="paragraph">Ellie didn't have the time or money to test every meter, so she focused on a sample of 50 meters located in different parts of the city. To avoid inconveniencing motorists, she did her research after 6 P.M. and on Sundays, when the meters were not in use. She put in eight minutes' worth of nickels in each meter, then measured how much time it really gave.</div><div class="paragraph">The results were not pretty. Ellie's findings suggested that more than nine out of every ten meters in the city were inaccurate—and that every fourth parking meter was running out of time too quickly. With 3,600 parking meters in the city, that meant a lot of undeserved tickets. As Ellie wrote in her science-project report, "I learned which meters cheat you and which meters cheat the City of Berkeley. But I learned that almost all meters cheat someone, so beware."</div><div class="paragraph">When the science fair rolled around, Ellie presented her findings with computer-generated charts and graphs. Her classmates weren't very interested in her project. "It's not like they have to drive a car or put money in a parking meter," she explains. But her project was a huge hit with parents. More than 50 of them lined up that night to share their own parking-meter horror stories with Ellie.</div><div class="paragraph">After that, word about Ellie's meter project spread fast. Within a few weeks, Ellie got a call from local politician Diane Woolley. At the time, Berkeley was considering replacing its meters with more accurate digital ones. Ellie shared her findings at city hall, and the politicians were impressed. "We don't get reports this thorough when we pay consultants hundreds of thousands of dollars," one remarked. Based on Ellie's study, they decided to purchase 2,000 new meters.</div><div class="paragraph">The California state legislature also decided to crack down on cheater meters. After Ellie presented her findings, they enacted "Lammer's Law," which requires California's 26 counties to test the accuracy of parking meters. Any meter found to be inaccurate must be fixed or dismantled.</div><div class="paragraph">California Governor Pete Wilson signed the law on November 1, 1998. At the time, he commented, "Ellie's ingenuity and dedication has earned her the gratitude of those Californians who've dug through their purses and pockets in search of exact change to feed the meters, only to return to find their cars bearing the dreaded green envelope of a parking ticket."</div><div class="paragraph">Ellie became a celebrity. She was in newspapers all over the country and featured on local television news during the summer and fall of 1998. CNN did a story about her. She was even a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman. "It was kind of a weird moment of being a celebrity," she says.</div><div class="paragraph">Ellie, who's now an eighth-grader at Martin Luther King Middle School, is proud of the work she's done. But she doesn't see meter monitoring as her life's work: "Right now I don't mind being known as the parking-meter girl, but I'm sure that later in life I'll want something different."</div><div class="attrib">© 2000 by Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

<div class="questionwrapper"><div class="question"><div class="stimulus"><div class="stimlabel">Reading Passage</div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:14pt" align="center"><span class="stressed_text_1">HOW THE BRAZILIAN BEETLES GOT THEIR COATS</span><div class="paragraph"></div><span class="stressed_text_1"><span class="stressed_text_2">RETOLD BY ELSIE EELLS</span></span></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">In Brazil the beetles have such beautifully colored, hard-shelled coats upon their backs that they are sometimes set in pins and necklaces like precious stones. Once upon a time, years and years ago, they had ordinary plain brown coats. This is how it happened that the Brazilian beetle earned a new coat.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">One day a little brown beetle was crawling along a wall when a big gray rat ran out of a hole in the wall and looked down scornfully at the little beetle."O ho!"he said to the beetle,"how slowly you crawl along. You'll never get anywhere in the world. Just look at me and see how fast I can run."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">The big gray rat ran to the end of the wall, wheeled around, and came back to the place where the little beetle was slowly crawling along at only a tiny distance from where the rat had left her.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">"Don't you wish that you could run like that?"said the big gray rat to the little brown beetle.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">"You are surely a fast runner,"replied the little brown beetle politely. Her mother had taught her always to be polite and had often said to her that a really polite beetle never boasts about her own accomplishments. The little brown beetle never boasted a single boast about the things she could do. She just went on slowly crawling along the wall.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">A bright green and gold parrot in the mango tree over the wall had heard the conversation."How would you like to race with the beetle?"he asked the big gray rat."I live next door to the tailor bird,"he added,"and just to make the race exciting I'll offer a brightly colored coat as a prize to the one who wins the race. You may choose for it any color you like and I'll have it made to order."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">"I'd like a yellow coat with stripes like the tiger's,"said the big gray rat, looking over his shoulder at his gaunt gray sides as if he were already admiring his new coat.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">"I'd like a beautiful, brightly colored new coat, too,"said the little brown beetle.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">The big gray rat laughed long and loud until his gaunt gray sides were shaking."Why, you talk just as if you thought you had a chance to win the race,"he said, when he could speak.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">The bright green and gold parrot set the royal palm tree at the top of the cliff as the goal of the race. He gave the signal to start and then he flew away to the royal palm tree to watch for the end of the race.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">The big gray rat ran as fast as he could. Then he thought how very tired he was getting."What's the use of hurrying?"he said to himself."The little brown beetle cannot possibly win. If I were racing with somebody who could really run it would be very different."Then he started to run more slowly, but every time his heart beat it said,"Hurry up! Hurry up!"The big gray rat decided that it was best to obey the little voice in his heart so he hurried just as fast as he could.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">When he reached the royal palm tree at the top of the cliff he could hardly believe his eyes. He thought he must be having a bad dream. There was the little brown beetle sitting quietly beside the bright green and gold parrot. The big gray rat had never been so surprised in all his life."How did you ever manage to run fast enough to get here so soon?"he asked the little brown beetle as soon as he could catch his breath.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">The little brown beetle drew out the tiny wings from her sides."Nobody said anything about having to run to win the race,"she replied,"so I flew instead."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">"I did not know that you could fly,"said the big gray rat in a subdued little voice.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">"After this,"said the bright green and gold parrot,"never judge anyone by his looks alone. You never can tell how often or where you may find concealed wings. You have lost the prize."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">Then the parrot turned to the little brown beetle who was waiting quietly at his side."What color do you want your new coat to be?"he asked.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">The little brown beetle looked up at the bright green and gold parrot, at the green and gold palm trees above their heads, at the green mangoes with golden flushes on their cheeks lying on the ground under the mango trees, at the golden sunshine upon the distant green hills."I choose a coat of green and gold,"she said.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">From that day to this the Brazilian beetle has worn a coat of green with golden lights upon it.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px;">And until this day, even in Brazil, where the flowers and birds and beasts and insects have such gorgeous coloring, the rat wears a dull gray coat.</div></div><br>174. <div class="paragraph">Which best describes the beetle's character?</div></div><div class="distractors"><div>A. <span class="itemtext"><span>Greedy</span></span></div>

Named after Samuel Ellis, the 27-acre knot of an island barely stuck out of the water at high tide.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Ellis Island became important to millions of immigrants in 1892, however, when the U.S. government converted it to an immigration station. Between 1892 and 1954, the island became—for more than 17 million souls—the doorway to America .</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">As you will see in their own words below, America offered immigrants more than just opportunity. You also will see that the "the land of the free" was not so free to everyone, after all.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Escaping to America</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The closing years of the 19th century were an oppressive time in many eastern and southern European nations. In such countries as Russia, Poland, and Armenia , millions of families were suffering. Wars, famines, and pogroms (organized massacres of Jews and other minorities) caused millions of people to flee.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Ida Mouradjian fled to America from Armenia to escape annihilation by the Turkish government:</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">They [the Turks] would displace every Armenian out of their own homes, out of their own towns and drive them into the Syrian Desert. The idea was to get every Armenian there and by the time they got there they would either die of hunger or exposure or pestilence.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">But not all were running from the horrors of violence or poverty. Some, like Theodore Lubik from the Ukraine, wanted to avoid the military draft and simply saw the U.S. as a great opportunity:</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">A friend of mine, he had gone to America . He came to Europe once on a visit...He looked just like a governor—horses, wagon, dressed fine, giving his pocket change to us. He gave me ten cents or a quarter—that was big money.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Hard Time Traveling</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">In these times of turmoil, one could not easily move to the U.S. The trials of getting to Ellis Island were often life-threatening in themselves.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Along the way, many immigrants had to contend with border guards, thieves, and crooked immigration agents. But it was the trip across the Atlantic that immigrants tended to remember most.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Crammed into poorly ventilated sleeping areas or cabins below deck, immigrants—many of whom had never seen the sea before—often suffered rough crossings. Vera Gauditsa, pregnant during her crossing from Czechoslovakia , remembered the torture of seasickness:</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">I was pretty tough, but on the boat I was very sick. I thought the child wanted to be born right then.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">I had a cabin, but in the cabin was nothing. You had to go through the whole boat to get to the showers and a toilet. So imagine when you are sick and you have to go to the bathroom and walk!</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">But upon seeing their destination, most immigrants—like Sarah Asher from Russia —forgot about sickness and thought only of a bright future:</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">About four or five o'clock in the morning we all got up. The sunshine started and what do we see? The Statue of Liberty !</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_2">Well, she was beautiful with the early-morning light. Everybody was crying. Beautiful colors, the greenish-like water</span> — <span class="stressed_text_2">and so big. We could see New York already, with the big buildings and everything</span> . . . <span class="stressed_text_2">There was a house where the boat stopped but only the Americans were able to go out, but we foreigners remained. Our boat moved further, and that was when we realized we were going to Ellis Island.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Stuck at the Door</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Having to wait while first- and second-class passengers got off the boat, many immigrants began to realize that their troubles were not over.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">After docking at Manhattan Island, immigrants in steerage were shipped by barge to Ellis Island, to go through examinations. On the island, the immigrants were guided into holding pens in the Great Hall. Irene Zambelli, from Greece , recalled the routine:</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_2">There were little gates, the same as you go [through] to the subways</span> . . . <span class="stressed_text_2">The first gate we [Irene and her cousin] passed they asked what we were to one another. Then we came to the next gate and they asked us how much was two and two, and four and four. We answered and went to the next gate.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Cutting Back the Flow</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The number of immigrants increased over the years, peaking at 1,285,349 in 1907. U.S. officials grew concerned. They saw the growing numbers as a threat to American workers. The officials were afraid the foreigners would take away wages and jobs. As a result, the entrance examinations were made tougher. They included a medical exam and a literacy test.

<div class="questionwrapper"><div class="question"><div class="stimulus"><div class="stimlabel">Reading Passage</div><div class="paragraph"><div class="prose1"><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size=150%"><span class="stressed_text_1">Dr. Shannon Lucid: Space Pioneer</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size=150%"><span class="stressed_text_1">by Vicki Oransky Wittenstein</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">When Shannon Lucid was growing up in Bethany, Oklahoma, during the 1950s, she dreamed of exploring outer space. She loved pioneer stories about America's West, and felt she had been born too late.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">But then she read about rocket inventor Robert Goddard. She realized that she had not been born too late to be a space explorer!</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">And explore space she did. On September 26, 1996, after a month's delay, Dr. Lucid returned to Earth after spending more than six months on the Russian space station <span class="stressed_text_2">Mir</span>.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Dr. Lucid was the second American astronaut to live aboard <span class="stressed_text_2">Mir</span> as part of a program to study how long-term travel in space affects the human body. The results will help the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) develop an international space station.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Dr. Lucid loved life in orbit. She said: "One of the best things to do is to look out the window and see the Earth, and watch the seasons change. I got to see the ice in all the lakes break up, and the Earth bloom."</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Now she holds the American and women's record for the longest stay in space, and she received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor from President Clinton.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">Adventurous Spirit</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">It's possible that Dr. Lucid became an adventurous spirit when she was a baby. Her parents took her along as they traveled throughout China during and after World War II. The family settled in the United States when Shannon was six, but the future astronaut was always looking forward to the adventure of another move.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">She pursued her love of science and her dream of space travel. As a result, she earned a pilot's license and degrees in chemistry and biochemistry.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">But she was disappointed when NASA accepted only men to its first space program in 1959 and 1960. When NASA finally admitted women in 1978, Dr. Lucid was one of the first six women to be accepted. And she was a crew member on several successful space shuttle missions.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">Aboard <span class="stressed_text_2">Mir</span></span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">On the Russian space station, Dr. Lucid's determination helped her cope with the stress of weightlessness, a small living space, and a diet of dehydrated foods.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">She also learned from the first American to live aboard <span class="stressed_text_2">Mir</span>, Dr. Norman Thagard. Dr. Thagard had lost seventeen pounds while eating unfamiliar Russian food, and he had been lonely.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Dr. Lucid was determined to stay healthy and happy. She took some American foods, such as shrimp, tomatoes, potato chips, and candy. Supply ships delivered her favorite snacks as well as fresh fruits and vegetables.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">And she stayed in touch with her family. Messages and books came from home. She wrote to her family through daily E-mail and talked to them in frequent "visits" by radio and television.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">To stay fit in space, Dr. Lucid spent hundreds of hours exercising on a treadmill and stationary bicycle. Although she was in space longer than any other American, she maintained her weight. Also, she lost only a little strength in her bones and muscles.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">When she returned to Earth, she surprised everyone because she was still strong enough to walk off the space shuttle instead of being carried.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">While on <span class="stressed_text_2">Mir</span>, Dr. Lucid also did research. In experiments on the development of quail eggs and growing wheat, she studied the effects of weightlessness on living things. In fact, her own body was an experiment in human adaptation to space. Dr. Lucid also studied ocean currents and photographed Earth.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">She enjoyed life on <span class="stressed_text_2">Mir</span> but missed bookstores, gooey desserts, the sun, the wind, and in-line skating with her daughters. "You really were isolated," she said. "You just couldn't run out and buy some fresh fruit."</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">Two Yuris</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Dr. Lucid's companions for most of her stay were two men, Russian cosmonauts named Yuri Usachov and Yuri Onufriyenko.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Dr. Lucid's mission was successful partly because she had a good relationship with the cosmonauts.

By 1954, Ellis Island had been shut down.</div><div class="paragraph">But for those who had passed through, America was truly a land of opportunity—despite often-severe hardships.

Named after Samuel Ellis, the 27-acre knot of an island barely stuck out of the water at high tide.</div><div class="paragraph">Ellis Island became important to millions of immigrants in 1892, however, when the U.S. government converted it to an immigration station. Between 1892 and 1954, the island became—for more than 17 million souls—the doorway to America .</div><div class="paragraph">As you will see in their own words below, America offered immigrants more than just opportunity. You also will see that the "the land of the free" was not so free to everyone, after all.</div><div class="paragraph">Escaping to America</div><div class="paragraph">The closing years of the 19th century were an oppressive time in many eastern and southern European nations. In such countries as Russia, Poland, and Armenia , millions of families were suffering. Wars, famines, and pogroms (organized massacres of Jews and other minorities) caused millions of people to flee.</div><div class="paragraph">Ida Mouradjian fled to America from Armenia to escape annihilation by the Turkish government:</div><div class="paragraph">They [the Turks] would displace every Armenian out of their own homes, out of their own towns and drive them into the Syrian Desert. The idea was to get every Armenian there and by the time they got there they would either die of hunger or exposure or pestilence.</div><div class="paragraph">But not all were running from the horrors of violence or poverty. Some, like Theodore Lubik from the Ukraine, wanted to avoid the military draft and simply saw the U.S. as a great opportunity:</div><div class="paragraph">A friend of mine, he had gone to America . He came to Europe once on a visit...He looked just like a governor—horses, wagon, dressed fine, giving his pocket change to us. He gave me ten cents or a quarter—that was big money.</div><div class="paragraph">Hard Time Traveling</div><div class="paragraph">In these times of turmoil, one could not easily move to the U.S. The trials of getting to Ellis Island were often life-threatening in themselves.</div><div class="paragraph">Along the way, many immigrants had to contend with border guards, thieves, and crooked immigration agents. But it was the trip across the Atlantic that immigrants tended to remember most.</div><div class="paragraph">Crammed into poorly ventilated sleeping areas or cabins below deck, immigrants—many of whom had never seen the sea before—often suffered rough crossings. Vera Gauditsa, pregnant during her crossing from Czechoslovakia , remembered the torture of seasickness:</div><div class="paragraph">I was pretty tough, but on the boat I was very sick. I thought the child wanted to be born right then.</div><div class="paragraph">I had a cabin, but in the cabin was nothing. You had to go through the whole boat to get to the showers and a toilet. So imagine when you are sick and you have to go to the bathroom and walk!</div><div class="paragraph">But upon seeing their destination, most immigrants—like Sarah Asher from Russia —forgot about sickness and thought only of a bright future:</div><div class="paragraph">About four or five o'clock in the morning we all got up. The sunshine started and what do we see? The Statue of Liberty !</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">Well, she was beautiful with the early-morning light. Everybody was crying. Beautiful colors, the greenish-like water</span> — <span class="stressed_text_2">and so big. We could see New York already, with the big buildings and everything</span> . . . <span class="stressed_text_2">There was a house where the boat stopped but only the Americans were able to go out, but we foreigners remained. Our boat moved further, and that was when we realized we were going to Ellis Island.</span></div><div class="paragraph">Stuck at the Door</div><div class="paragraph">Having to wait while first- and second-class passengers got off the boat, many immigrants began to realize that their troubles were not over.</div><div class="paragraph">After docking at Manhattan Island, immigrants in steerage were shipped by barge to Ellis Island, to go through examinations. On the island, the immigrants were guided into holding pens in the Great Hall. Irene Zambelli, from Greece , recalled the routine:</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">There were little gates, the same as you go [through] to the subways</span> . . . <span class="stressed_text_2">The first gate we [Irene and her cousin] passed they asked what we were to one another. Then we came to the next gate and they asked us how much was two and two, and four and four. We answered and went to the next gate.</span></div><div class="paragraph">Cutting Back the Flow</div><div class="paragraph">The number of immigrants increased over the years, peaking at 1,285,349 in 1907. U.S. officials grew concerned. They saw the growing numbers as a threat to American workers. The officials were afraid the foreigners would take away wages and jobs. As a result, the entrance examinations were made tougher. They included a medical exam and a literacy test. An immigrant who failed one of these tests faced <span class="stressed_text_1">deportation</span> (being sent back) to his or her native country.</div><div class="paragraph">Of all the examinations, the medical exam seemed to cause immigrants the most concern, recalled Catherine Bolinski, who came from Poland :</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">They turned your eye[lid] over</span> — <span class="stressed_text_2">I had to blink a couple of times that way. I'll never forget it. They looked at your throat and to see if you had any rashes on your body. They found things wrong with some people. They sent them back, after they [had] sold everything to come here, so they were crying, they felt very bad.</span></div><div class="paragraph">The thought of being deported was terrifying. Fannie Kligerman, who escaped from Russia with her family, remembered the fear:</div><div class="paragraph">One of my brothers had something wrong with him. It was a sty. It left a funny thing and they put him aside. And they told us that if there was anything wrong with him, he'd have to go back to Europe. Oh, it was frightening.

Named after Samuel Ellis, the 27-acre knot of an island barely stuck out of the water at high tide.</div><div class="paragraph">Ellis Island became important to millions of immigrants in 1892, however, when the U.S. government converted it to an immigration station. Between 1892 and 1954, the island became—for more than 17 million souls—the doorway to America .</div><div class="paragraph">As you will see in their own words below, America offered immigrants more than just opportunity. You also will see that the "the land of the free" was not so free to everyone, after all.</div><div class="paragraph">Escaping to America</div><div class="paragraph">The closing years of the 19th century were an oppressive time in many eastern and southern European nations. In such countries as Russia, Poland, and Armenia , millions of families were suffering. Wars, famines, and pogroms (organized massacres of Jews and other minorities) caused millions of people to flee.</div><div class="paragraph">Ida Mouradjian fled to America from Armenia to escape annihilation by the Turkish government:</div><div class="paragraph">They [the Turks] would displace every Armenian out of their own homes, out of their own towns and drive them into the Syrian Desert. The idea was to get every Armenian there and by the time they got there they would either die of hunger or exposure or pestilence.</div><div class="paragraph">But not all were running from the horrors of violence or poverty. Some, like Theodore Lubik from the Ukraine, wanted to avoid the military draft and simply saw the U.S. as a great opportunity:</div><div class="paragraph">A friend of mine, he had gone to America . He came to Europe once on a visit...He looked just like a governor—horses, wagon, dressed fine, giving his pocket change to us. He gave me ten cents or a quarter—that was big money.</div><div class="paragraph">Hard Time Traveling</div><div class="paragraph">In these times of turmoil, one could not easily move to the U.S. The trials of getting to Ellis Island were often life-threatening in themselves.</div><div class="paragraph">Along the way, many immigrants had to contend with border guards, thieves, and crooked immigration agents. But it was the trip across the Atlantic that immigrants tended to remember most.</div><div class="paragraph">Crammed into poorly ventilated sleeping areas or cabins below deck, immigrants—many of whom had never seen the sea before—often suffered rough crossings. Vera Gauditsa, pregnant during her crossing from Czechoslovakia , remembered the torture of seasickness:</div><div class="paragraph">I was pretty tough, but on the boat I was very sick. I thought the child wanted to be born right then.</div><div class="paragraph">I had a cabin, but in the cabin was nothing. You had to go through the whole boat to get to the showers and a toilet. So imagine when you are sick and you have to go to the bathroom and walk!</div><div class="paragraph">But upon seeing their destination, most immigrants—like Sarah Asher from Russia —forgot about sickness and thought only of a bright future:</div><div class="paragraph">About four or five o'clock in the morning we all got up. The sunshine started and what do we see? The Statue of Liberty !</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">Well, she was beautiful with the early-morning light. Everybody was crying. Beautiful colors, the greenish-like water</span> — <span class="stressed_text_2">and so big. We could see New York already, with the big buildings and everything</span> . . . <span class="stressed_text_2">There was a house where the boat stopped but only the Americans were able to go out, but we foreigners remained. Our boat moved further, and that was when we realized we were going to Ellis Island.</span></div><div class="paragraph">Stuck at the Door</div><div class="paragraph">Having to wait while first- and second-class passengers got off the boat, many immigrants began to realize that their troubles were not over.</div><div class="paragraph">After docking at Manhattan Island, immigrants in steerage were shipped by barge to Ellis Island, to go through examinations. On the island, the immigrants were guided into holding pens in the Great Hall. Irene Zambelli, from Greece , recalled the routine:</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">There were little gates, the same as you go [through] to the subways</span> . . . <span class="stressed_text_2">The first gate we [Irene and her cousin] passed they asked what we were to one another. Then we came to the next gate and they asked us how much was two and two, and four and four. We answered and went to the next gate.</span></div><div class="paragraph">Cutting Back the Flow</div><div class="paragraph">The number of immigrants increased over the years, peaking at 1,285,349 in 1907. U.S. officials grew concerned. They saw the growing numbers as a threat to American workers. The officials were afraid the foreigners would take away wages and jobs. As a result, the entrance examinations were made tougher. They included a medical exam and a literacy test. An immigrant who failed one of these tests faced <span class="stressed_text_1">deportation</span> (being sent back) to his or her native country.</div><div class="paragraph">Of all the examinations, the medical exam seemed to cause immigrants the most concern, recalled Catherine Bolinski, who came from Poland :</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">They turned your eye[lid] over</span> — <span class="stressed_text_2">I had to blink a couple of times that way. I'll never forget it. They looked at your throat and to see if you had any rashes on your body. They found things wrong with some people. They sent them back, after they [had] sold everything to come here, so they were crying, they felt very bad.</span></div><div class="paragraph">The thought of being deported was terrifying. Fannie Kligerman, who escaped from Russia with her family, remembered the fear:</div><div class="paragraph">One of my brothers had something wrong with him. It was a sty. It left a funny thing and they put him aside. And they told us that if there was anything wrong with him, he'd have to go back to Europe. Oh, it was frightening. My father said, "I'm not going on without the children. We will all go back."</div><div class="paragraph">Charting America's Course</div><div class="paragraph">Only three percent of those who arrived at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954 were turned away. By 1924, however, the government changed its policy. It slammed shut the "open door" that had allowed so many millions to flock to the U.S. The Immigration Act of 1924 set a quota of 164,000 immigrants per year. By 1954, Ellis Island had been shut down.</div><div class="paragraph">But for those who had passed through, America was truly a land of opportunity—despite often-severe hardships. Settling throughout the U.S., immigrants such as composer Irving Berlin, football coach Knute Rockne, and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter added to America 's strength.</div><div class="paragraph">Having escaped from Russia, Arnold Weiss voiced the determination and hope of the immigrants who passed through Ellis Island:</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">From the whole story of what I went through in all my years</span> — <span class="stressed_text_2">and some of it wasn't very pleasant</span>— <span class="stressed_text_2">I still love this country. I love this country in spite of everything.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">From " <span class="stressed_text_2">Ellis Island: Doorway to America</span> " by Bill Walter.

Her brother, senior by a couple of significant years, accompanied her:   two dark-eyed travelers seeking roomier futures than the ones they stood to inherit at home. Leaving behind three younger sisters and a widowed mother, they strolled toward the possibilities that an uncle, well settled in a woolens business in London, might provide. They carried everything on their backs, food and shoes and such, the goodbyes. At night they slept in fields, in barns when the weather turned. They picked up crumbs of new languages, mouthfuls to get by on. There is no record of this legendary journey apart from the remembered and recounted one; no documentary diaries, no franked passports, no railway or steamship ticket stubs, no hotel bills, no souvenir photographs or trinkets, no many-creased maps. Did it happen, as told? I believe so. I always believed so, although I knew the reports had been altered by the time they reached me, embroidered, translated, aggrandized, I supposed. Even so, I swallowed them whole, lured and hooked like a trout by a glitteringly fabulous fly.

She didn</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t sing for money; they had all the cash they needed wrapped in handkerchiefs in their rucksacks. She sang for the pure joy of adding her note to those that hovered, purling and trilling, in the pellucid sea air. Making a musical offering to gods whose existence she hadn</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t even suspected, she sang folk songs in the dialect of her girlhood. Her voice, small, untrained, may have moved a heart or two. In Antibes, singing on a boulevard planted with flowering laurels, she was sketched by a man sitting on the terrace of a cafe. It could have been Matisse, we like to think; the dates and place are right. The man showed her the sketch but he did not give it to her.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="layout-grid-mode:line">My grandmother arrived in London about seven months after she commenced walking. Her cheeks were flushed, tomato-red, despite the rough Channel crossing. Long ropy muscles snaked down her legs to her narrow feet. Between them, she and her brother had gone through five pairs of what they claimed were sturdy boots, and through something less tangible, not measurable in distance covered or time elapsed.</span> "<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">Why did you walk? Why didn</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t you go on trains?</span>" <span class="layout-grid-mode:line">I asked her once when I was nine or so and liked the mechanics of events to be fleshed out so I could grasp them more tightly.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">I was too beauty for men in irons,</span>" <span class="layout-grid-mode:line">she answered.</span> "<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">Only stars could have my shining.</span>" <span class="layout-grid-mode:line">She was said to be</span> "<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">somewhat</span>" <span class="layout-grid-mode:line">senile, a vague qualifier for an already vague condition. But I could usually catch the drift of her scattered words. She caught my more regular ones. We understood each other.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="layout-grid-mode:line">Soon after reaching London, my grandmother made what must be seen as a brilliant match, acquiescing to arrangements set in motion by her uncle prior to her arrival. Was this match to her liking? Did her likings matter? These are conjectures. The fact appears to be that a future was perceived and undertaken by a woman whose legs may have been stronger than her spirit and whose song, it is possible, was silenced. I know what she told me, repeatedly.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">I was my dream under a lock of petals,</span>" <span class="layout-grid-mode:line">she used to say, pointing to her wedding portrait in the snapshot album we looked at together week after week on the Saturday afternoons of my childhood; pictures were the safety net for what fell from her memory</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">s difficult trapeze act.</span> "<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">Seven times I swanned around my stranger, then the glass broke awake to weeping. Salt in the mouth was my sadness to come.</span>"</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="layout-grid-mode:line">Sadness?

Or else I was too young to recognize what I saw, a fadedness of sorts, but one I felt was due to a lack of color rather than of cheer. The three rooms of her apartment were done in a variety of whites. Alabaster, ivory, off-white, cream-white, and eggshell puddled into custards on the walls and upholstery, at the silk-swagged windows, on the painted tables and bureaus and kitchen cupboards. Even the rugs on the floors were pallid, washed over the years into what was no more than a thin reminder of beiges and blues. She was blanched too:   snowy hair, chalky powdered face, starched white lace and linen blouses, pearly teeth she constantly took out of her soft oystery mouth to amuse me, herself also. She</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">d hand me the wet dentures and say something like,</span> "<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">Jewels to be is on the tongue. Try me on.</span>" <span class="layout-grid-mode:line">We laughed and laughed as I tried to clamp her false teeth between my lips like Halloween vampire fangs.

We played cards. We baked cupcakes. We knitted wispy mohair mufflers for the entire family. We studied the single photo album she brought to this country, and she told me stories prompted by the pictures.</span> "<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">In the days of oaks,</span>" <span class="layout-grid-mode:line">she</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">d begin; that was her habitual opening phrase.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="layout-grid-mode:line">In my own days of oaks, Granny, there were questions I might have asked you but didn</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t think of then. One, especially one question haunts me now, about the one photograph you kept on your bedside table to look at all the time, not just once a week when I came to visit you and we pored over the album for clues to remembering. The photograph I want to know about, the one you didn</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t hide between the tooled leather covers of a book that was further hidden in a drawer between layers of your silky white underwear, is of a person you seldom mentioned to me, a man I never knew because he died in the blitz before I was born.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="layout-grid-mode:line">My grandfather struts on a seaside esplanade, straw-hatted, wearing a snappy striped blazer. His stance is jaunty. He looks extremely pleased, although there isn</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t a smile below his mustache. His chin points toward his left shoulder, a birdlike tilt of the head. One hand grips a silver-headed walking stick, the other is tucked into the pocket of his white flannel pants. He is a tall slim man casting a sharp pencil-slim shadow on the paved promenade. At a distance behind him, behind a wrought-iron railing, a pier stretches across the pebbled beach and stilts into the sea. There is some kind of pavilion at the end of the pier above the water, a roofed but open-sided structure. It could have been Brighton, in August perhaps. The picture must have been taken very early in the morning, given the look and angle of his shadow. There aren</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t any other people in the picture, no other strollers on the broad esplanade, no children squatting at the sea</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">s curly edge. Even in the old and faded photograph, the summer morning light is so splendid and immense it fills the image and its subject with bright importance.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="layout-grid-mode:line">What I want to know is this, Granny:   Where were you? Why aren</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t you on his arm as in all the other vacation snaps in the album, smiling at the photographer approaching and inviting you both to pose, please? What was it about this picture you</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">re not in that made you keep it out? Did it remind you of something you wouldn</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t talk about even when I asked you the questions I could then? Was that your salty sadness:   his self-importance? Did he shine so sharply, absolutely, right in your eyes, dazzling you into arranging for a conspicuous absence of yourself, paling your intense promising colors until they were out of season for you? Did he white you out even then?</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="layout-grid-mode:line">Dying, my grandmother</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">s determination was vivid again; her courage as fresh as young grass. I hadn</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t ever seen her so lofty, almost imperious; death was a dirty penny she wouldn</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t stoop for. I was summoned from college to her sickroom, at home, to collect what she insisted on passing to me in person, making a physical gesture that resonated far louder and clearer than any testamental paper bell could. We had already said some of our farewells a month earlier when I was home on Christmas break, but certain matters had to be postponed until the last possible minute. She was in bed dozing, waiting for me, face powdered and cheeks rouged as though for a pleasanter outing. My kiss woke her. I couldn</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t see the sickness below her skin, the sly cells chewing through bone, excavating an insidious one-way tunnel. She still looked intact to me; only her dark eyes were worn, sunk deep in their sockets like eight balls dropping for end shots. I plumped up her pillows, propped her to a sitting position, and sat down on the edge of her bed. My mother left the room to take a nap, make some coffee or calls, go for a walk, get away from her mother-in-law</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">s deathbed for the short time I was there to spell her.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">Eyes, darling eyes,</span>" <span class="layout-grid-mode:line">my grandmother greeted me,</span> "<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">don</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">t water me now, I</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">m for drying.

I thanked her.</span> "<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">Bauble me not!</span>" <span class="layout-grid-mode:line">she commanded.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="layout-grid-mode:line">Then we got down to business.

I moved to her side, leaned back on the pillows with her, our knees bent up to form a book rest. Then we did what we</span>'<span class="layout-grid-mode:line">d always done, turned the pages one by one.

"I think she's coming!"</div><div class="paragraph">Elisa and Cory stifled their giggles and crouched behind the pine tree. Peeping out through the snow-covered branches, the children held their breath and listened for the tinkle of Minnie's collar as the old dog tried to find their hiding place. It was usually the hound's favorite game, but today the only sounds the children heard were the wind whistling softly across the frozen snow and ice cracking on the river.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Cory shivered with cold. "I wonder where she is," he said. "I hope she isn't off chasing a deer."</div><div class="paragraph">Elisa snorted. "Minnie's too lame for that. I bet she went home to wait where it's nice and warm."</div><div class="paragraph">Cory looked doubtful. "She wouldn't go home without us," he said. "Maybe she got ahead, and we didn't notice. Let's go to the bridge and see if she's there."</div><div class="paragraph">They started down the trail at a quick pace, glad to be moving again. The bare branches of the trees rattled forlornly as they tramped through the frozen snow.</div><div class="paragraph">Elisa struggled hard to keep up with her older brother. "Wouldn't it be easier to walk on the ice on the river?" she called to him.</div><div class="paragraph">Cory slowed his pace and waited for her to catch up. "It's too dangerous," he said. "The water is still flowing underneath, and the ice is thin. We might fall through." He held out a mittened hand. "I'll help you."</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">"No, thanks," said Elisa stubbornly. "I can keep up." But she was secretly glad when Cory walked beside her until they reached the bridge.</div><div class="paragraph">The old wooden bridge spanned the widest part of the river. In summer they often came here to fish or lie in the sun, but now it was a desolate, wind-swept place. They could hear the water gurgling softly beneath the ice as they looked out over the railing, hoping to glimpse Minnie walking along the bank.</div><div class="paragraph">Cory cupped his hands to his mouth and called, "Minnie, Min-nie!" His voice echoed back to him from the lonely woods. "I don't see her, Elisa. Do you?" he asked.</div><div class="paragraph">Just then Elisa gave a startled cry, and Cory turned sharply to see Minnie ten feet from shore. The old dog had fallen through the ice and was paddling in desperate circles.</div><div class="paragraph">"Hang on, Minnie, I'm coming!" Cory cried, racing toward the river. Elisa was already ahead of him, pulling off her coat, scarf, and mittens, ready to plunge in and save her dog. Blinded by tears, she stumbled out onto the ice.</div><div class="paragraph">Cory caught up with her and pulled her back. "Do you want to drown yourself?" he shouted. His face was white as he held out the warm clothes she'd dropped. "Put these back on and let me think of something." He looked grimly at the river.</div><div class="paragraph">Elisa sobbed as she struggled into her coat. "You can save her, can't you, Cory? She won't die, will she?"</div><div class="paragraph">"Of course not," he said, wishing he felt as confident as he was trying to sound.</div><div class="paragraph">The sight of her masters had given Minnie new hope, and she managed to get her front paws up on the ice. She scratched and clawed frantically at the slippery surface, but her hind legs were too arthritic to be of much help. For a moment her frightened brown eyes met Cory's, then she slipped back into the icy water and began wearily swimming once more.</div><div class="paragraph">Cory searched the bank until he found a long, twisted branch. Holding it firmly, he maneuvered the end until he had it hooked under Minnie's collar. "C'mon, girl," he said to the tired dog. She heaved her front paws onto the ice and struggled desperately while he tried to help her by pulling on the branch. But frost and moisture had made the wood brittle, and it snapped almost immediately. Once more Minnie struck out swimming, but now her head was barely above the surface of the water.</div><div class="paragraph">A terrible thought crossed Cory's mind — Minnie was going to drown before their eyes. It's not fair, he thought. Why doesn't someone come along to help us? He scanned the woods for a game warden or hunter, but saw no one. The woods were dark and silent, waiting. "I don't know what to do," he said, frightened.</div><div class="paragraph">"I know what to do," cried Elisa. "I'm going to help her!"</div><div class="paragraph">Once again Cory grabbed his sister's arm to prevent her from going out onto the ice. She bit and kicked at him like a small fury as tears of frustration ran down her cheeks.</div><div class="paragraph">"Listen to me!" yelled Cory. "I thought of something, but I need your help." Elisa wiped the tears from her face. "I'm going to lie down on the ice and try to crawl to Minnie. You lie down behind me and hold my ankles. Don't let go, no matter what, and don't stand up. Understand?" Elisa nodded, sniffling.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Cory lay on the ice so that his weight would be distributed more evenly and there would be less chance of breaking through. He felt Elisa's hands close around his ankles. As he inched his way forward, he could hear the water rushing beneath the ice. A few feet in front of him was the deep green hole where the dog had broken through. Cory's heart pounded with fear, but he bit his lip and kept going. At last he reached the edge of the hole and threw his arms around Minnie's neck. It felt reassuring to have a hold on her, but he soon realized that there was little else he could do. The ice was slippery, and every time he tried to pull her out, he began to slide forward himself.</div><div class="paragraph">"Have you got her?" called Elisa anxiously.</div><div class="paragraph">"Yes," Cory yelled over his shoulder, "but I can't—" Before he could explain, he found himself being pulled back across the ice with Minnie in his arms. He looked around in amazement, expecting to see a big man with a broad grin standing behind him, but there was only his sturdy little sister, laughing and crawling over the ice to throw her arms around the shivering dog. "How did you ever do that?" cried Cory. "You're not that strong!" Then as Minnie, tail wagging wildly, began to lick his face, he saw what had happened.</div><div class="paragraph">Elisa had put her wool coat down on the ice to protect her from the cold. The warmth of her body lying on the top of it had made the wool fibers stick firmly to the ice so that when she pulled on Cory's legs, he slipped across the surface to her as easily as a cork popping from a bottle.</div><div class="paragraph">Cory grinned in admiration. "You sure are one smart little sister!" he said, tousling her hair. He took off his plaid shirt and dried Minnie with it. "It's a good thing we were all together today," he said to the old dog softly as he rubbed her lopsided ears. She wagged her tail in agreement, and the three hurried toward the warmth of home without looking back.<img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(38)" alt="Drawing of a young boy and girl with a dog" title="Drawing of a young boy and girl with a dog" height="355" width="550" align="middle"></div><div class="paragraph">Copyright © 1992 Yetti Frenkel.</div></div></div></div><br>198. <div class="paragraph" style="padding-left:40px">The main problem Cory faced was</div></div><div class="distractors"><div>A. <span class="itemtext"><span>convincing Elisa to keep her coat on</span></span></div>

"I think she's coming!"</div><div class="paragraph">Elisa and Cory stifled their giggles and crouched behind the pine tree. Peeping out through the snow-covered branches, the children held their breath and listened for the tinkle of Minnie's collar as the old dog tried to find their hiding place. It was usually the hound's favorite game, but today the only sounds the children heard were the wind whistling softly across the frozen snow and ice cracking on the river.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Cory shivered with cold. "I wonder where she is," he said. "I hope she isn't off chasing a deer."</div><div class="paragraph">Elisa snorted. "Minnie's too lame for that. I bet she went home to wait where it's nice and warm."</div><div class="paragraph">Cory looked doubtful. "She wouldn't go home without us," he said. "Maybe she got ahead, and we didn't notice. Let's go to the bridge and see if she's there."</div><div class="paragraph">They started down the trail at a quick pace, glad to be moving again. The bare branches of the trees rattled forlornly as they tramped through the frozen snow.</div><div class="paragraph">Elisa struggled hard to keep up with her older brother. "Wouldn't it be easier to walk on the ice on the river?" she called to him.</div><div class="paragraph">Cory slowed his pace and waited for her to catch up. "It's too dangerous," he said. "The water is still flowing underneath, and the ice is thin. We might fall through." He held out a mittened hand. "I'll help you."</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">"No, thanks," said Elisa stubbornly. "I can keep up." But she was secretly glad when Cory walked beside her until they reached the bridge.</div><div class="paragraph">The old wooden bridge spanned the widest part of the river. In summer they often came here to fish or lie in the sun, but now it was a desolate, wind-swept place. They could hear the water gurgling softly beneath the ice as they looked out over the railing, hoping to glimpse Minnie walking along the bank.</div><div class="paragraph">Cory cupped his hands to his mouth and called, "Minnie, Min-nie!" His voice echoed back to him from the lonely woods. "I don't see her, Elisa. Do you?" he asked.</div><div class="paragraph">Just then Elisa gave a startled cry, and Cory turned sharply to see Minnie ten feet from shore. The old dog had fallen through the ice and was paddling in desperate circles.</div><div class="paragraph">"Hang on, Minnie, I'm coming!" Cory cried, racing toward the river. Elisa was already ahead of him, pulling off her coat, scarf, and mittens, ready to plunge in and save her dog. Blinded by tears, she stumbled out onto the ice.</div><div class="paragraph">Cory caught up with her and pulled her back. "Do you want to drown yourself?" he shouted. His face was white as he held out the warm clothes she'd dropped. "Put these back on and let me think of something." He looked grimly at the river.</div><div class="paragraph">Elisa sobbed as she struggled into her coat. "You can save her, can't you, Cory? She won't die, will she?"</div><div class="paragraph">"Of course not," he said, wishing he felt as confident as he was trying to sound.</div><div class="paragraph">The sight of her masters had given Minnie new hope, and she managed to get her front paws up on the ice. She scratched and clawed frantically at the slippery surface, but her hind legs were too arthritic to be of much help. For a moment her frightened brown eyes met Cory's, then she slipped back into the icy water and began wearily swimming once more.</div><div class="paragraph">Cory searched the bank until he found a long, twisted branch. Holding it firmly, he maneuvered the end until he had it hooked under Minnie's collar. "C'mon, girl," he said to the tired dog. She heaved her front paws onto the ice and struggled desperately while he tried to help her by pulling on the branch. But frost and moisture had made the wood brittle, and it snapped almost immediately. Once more Minnie struck out swimming, but now her head was barely above the surface of the water.</div><div class="paragraph">A terrible thought crossed Cory's mind — Minnie was going to drown before their eyes. It's not fair, he thought. Why doesn't someone come along to help us? He scanned the woods for a game warden or hunter, but saw no one. The woods were dark and silent, waiting. "I don't know what to do," he said, frightened.</div><div class="paragraph">"I know what to do," cried Elisa. "I'm going to help her!"</div><div class="paragraph">Once again Cory grabbed his sister's arm to prevent her from going out onto the ice. She bit and kicked at him like a small fury as tears of frustration ran down her cheeks.</div><div class="paragraph">"Listen to me!" yelled Cory. "I thought of something, but I need your help." Elisa wiped the tears from her face. "I'm going to lie down on the ice and try to crawl to Minnie. You lie down behind me and hold my ankles. Don't let go, no matter what, and don't stand up. Understand?" Elisa nodded, sniffling.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Cory lay on the ice so that his weight would be distributed more evenly and there would be less chance of breaking through. He felt Elisa's hands close around his ankles. As he inched his way forward, he could hear the water rushing beneath the ice. A few feet in front of him was the deep green hole where the dog had broken through. Cory's heart pounded with fear, but he bit his lip and kept going. At last he reached the edge of the hole and threw his arms around Minnie's neck. It felt reassuring to have a hold on her, but he soon realized that there was little else he could do. The ice was slippery, and every time he tried to pull her out, he began to slide forward himself.</div><div class="paragraph">"Have you got her?" called Elisa anxiously.</div><div class="paragraph">"Yes," Cory yelled over his shoulder, "but I can't—" Before he could explain, he found himself being pulled back across the ice with Minnie in his arms. He looked around in amazement, expecting to see a big man with a broad grin standing behind him, but there was only his sturdy little sister, laughing and crawling over the ice to throw her arms around the shivering dog. "How did you ever do that?" cried Cory. "You're not that strong!" Then as Minnie, tail wagging wildly, began to lick his face, he saw what had happened.</div><div class="paragraph">Elisa had put her wool coat down on the ice to protect her from the cold. The warmth of her body lying on the top of it had made the wool fibers stick firmly to the ice so that when she pulled on Cory's legs, he slipped across the surface to her as easily as a cork popping from a bottle.</div><div class="paragraph">Cory grinned in admiration. "You sure are one smart little sister!" he said, tousling her hair. He took off his plaid shirt and dried Minnie with it. "It's a good thing we were all together today," he said to the old dog softly as he rubbed her lopsided ears. She wagged her tail in agreement, and the three hurried toward the warmth of home without looking back.<img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(38)" alt="Drawing of a young boy and girl with a dog" title="Drawing of a young boy and girl with a dog" height="355" width="550" align="middle"></div><div class="paragraph">Copyright © 1992 Yetti Frenkel.</div></div></div></div><br>200. <div class="paragraph" style="padding-left:40px">This story could best be described as a</div></div><div class="distractors"><div>A. <span class="itemtext"><span>modern-day fairy tale</span></span></div>

We peered into the sparse scrub along the roadside and searched for the brown furry animals. In the distance we spotted a mob of red kangaroos bouncing out of sight, and near the road a crowlike bird called a currawong was perched, but nowhere did we see any wombats. However, we later found out that this was not surprising because we were traveling during midday, and wombats are active mostly at night. It wasn't until we visited the animal reserve that we finally saw our first wombat and learned more about this funny-looking creature.</div><div class="paragraph">We found that there are two types of wombats in Australia: the hairy-nosed wombat, which lives in Queensland and South Australia, and the coarse-haired wombat, which lives along the southeast coast. Both have soft brown fur, short ears, and thick-set bodies. They are said to resemble North American badgers. The hairy-nosed wombat is smaller and has pointier ears compared to its coarse-haired cousin; otherwise they are very much alike.</div><div class="paragraph">In many ways the wombat is similar to another Australian native, the koala. Like koalas, wombats have strong forelimbs and powerful claws. But instead of using its claws to cling to high tree branches as the koala does, the wombat digs large underground burrows. These burrows are usually nine to fifteen feet across, but they can be enormous — sometimes as long as ninety feet. One end of the burrow is used as a sleeping area — there the wombat builds a nest made of bark.</div><div class="paragraph">The wombat is a vegetarian, so it also uses its mighty claws to tear up grasses and roots for its food. A mother wombat will pull out single stems of grass and lay them on the ground so her young wombat can eat the tender bases. The wombat's teeth, which grow throughout its life, are sharp and ideal for cutting and tearing.</div><div class="paragraph">When a mother wombat gives birth, she never has to worry about finding a baby-sitter — she simply carries her baby along with her. Like most mammals in Australia, wombats are marsupials. A baby wombat is born at a very early stage of development and lives in its mother's pouch until it is old enough to survive on its own.</div><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(40)" alt="Sign that says Caution Wombat Crossing" title="Sign that says Caution Wombat Crossing" height="234" width="234" align="middle"><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Wombats have only one baby at a time, usually during the Australian winter months, May to July. A baby wombat is called a joey. At birth the tiny joey — barely an inch long — uses its forelimbs to pull itself along its mother's underside to get into her pouch, where it will be kept warm, protected, and fed.</div><div class="paragraph">Marsupials, like all mammals, are nourished by their mothers' milk. The nipples that supply the milk are inside the pouch. Once inside, the wombat joey finds a nipple and grabs it. The nipple then swells up in the baby's mouth, providing a firm hold and a steady supply of food. The joey stays in its mother's pouch for the next four months and grows rapidly.</div><div class="paragraph">Most marsupials have pouches which open upward when the animal is standing. However, both koalas and wombats have pouches which face downwards. A strong muscle keeps the pouch tightly closed and prevents the young wombat or koala from falling out. An advantage of the downward-opening pouch for wombats is that dirt is less likely to get inside when the wombat is burrowing.</div><div class="paragraph">The wombat is a shy and gentle animal. But even if you lived in Australia and were willing to keep watch during the nighttime hours, it would be difficult to get to know one. As more and more people move into territories in which wombats live, they destroy the wombat's burrows and food supplies. In some areas where the wombat was once plentiful, it is now almost extinct. Animal reserves have been set up recently to protect the wombat. Perhaps with a little help these friendly creatures will again prosper and multiply.

We peered into the sparse scrub along the roadside and searched for the brown furry animals. In the distance we spotted a mob of red kangaroos bouncing out of sight, and near the road a crowlike bird called a currawong was perched, but nowhere did we see any wombats. However, we later found out that this was not surprising because we were traveling during midday, and wombats are active mostly at night. It wasn't until we visited the animal reserve that we finally saw our first wombat and learned more about this funny-looking creature.</div><div class="paragraph">We found that there are two types of wombats in Australia: the hairy-nosed wombat, which lives in Queensland and South Australia, and the coarse-haired wombat, which lives along the southeast coast. Both have soft brown fur, short ears, and thick-set bodies. They are said to resemble North American badgers. The hairy-nosed wombat is smaller and has pointier ears compared to its coarse-haired cousin; otherwise they are very much alike.</div><div class="paragraph">In many ways the wombat is similar to another Australian native, the koala. Like koalas, wombats have strong forelimbs and powerful claws. But instead of using its claws to cling to high tree branches as the koala does, the wombat digs large underground burrows. These burrows are usually nine to fifteen feet across, but they can be enormous — sometimes as long as ninety feet. One end of the burrow is used as a sleeping area — there the wombat builds a nest made of bark.</div><div class="paragraph">The wombat is a vegetarian, so it also uses its mighty claws to tear up grasses and roots for its food. A mother wombat will pull out single stems of grass and lay them on the ground so her young wombat can eat the tender bases. The wombat's teeth, which grow throughout its life, are sharp and ideal for cutting and tearing.</div><div class="paragraph">When a mother wombat gives birth, she never has to worry about finding a baby-sitter — she simply carries her baby along with her. Like most mammals in Australia, wombats are marsupials. A baby wombat is born at a very early stage of development and lives in its mother's pouch until it is old enough to survive on its own.</div><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(40)" alt="Sign that says Caution Wombat Crossing" title="Sign that says Caution Wombat Crossing" height="234" width="234" align="middle"><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">Wombats have only one baby at a time, usually during the Australian winter months, May to July. A baby wombat is called a joey. At birth the tiny joey — barely an inch long — uses its forelimbs to pull itself along its mother's underside to get into her pouch, where it will be kept warm, protected, and fed.</div><div class="paragraph">Marsupials, like all mammals, are nourished by their mothers' milk. The nipples that supply the milk are inside the pouch. Once inside, the wombat joey finds a nipple and grabs it. The nipple then swells up in the baby's mouth, providing a firm hold and a steady supply of food. The joey stays in its mother's pouch for the next four months and grows rapidly.</div><div class="paragraph">Most marsupials have pouches which open upward when the animal is standing. However, both koalas and wombats have pouches which face downwards. A strong muscle keeps the pouch tightly closed and prevents the young wombat or koala from falling out. An advantage of the downward-opening pouch for wombats is that dirt is less likely to get inside when the wombat is burrowing.</div><div class="paragraph">The wombat is a shy and gentle animal. But even if you lived in Australia and were willing to keep watch during the nighttime hours, it would be difficult to get to know one. As more and more people move into territories in which wombats live, they destroy the wombat's burrows and food supplies. In some areas where the wombat was once plentiful, it is now almost extinct. Animal reserves have been set up recently to protect the wombat. Perhaps with a little help these friendly creatures will again prosper and multiply.

It had a long strap, and she carried it slung across her shoulder. It was about eleven o'clock at night, dark, and she was walking alone, when a boy ran up behind her and tried to snatch her purse. The strap broke with a sudden single tug the boy gave it from behind. But the boy's weight and the weight of the purse combined caused him to lose his balance. Instead of taking off full blast as he had hoped, the boy fell on his back on the sidewalk and his legs flew up. The large woman simply turned around and kicked him right square in his blue-jeaned sitter. Then she reached down, picked the boy up by his shirtfront, and shook him until his teeth rattled.</div><div class="paragraph">After that the woman said, "Pick up my pocketbook, boy, and give it here."</div><div class="paragraph">She still held him tightly. But she bent down enough to permit him to stoop and pick up her purse. Then she said, "Now ain't you ashamed of yourself?"</div><div class="paragraph">Firmly gripped by his shirtfront, the boy said, "Yes'm."</div><div class="paragraph">The woman said, "What did you want to do it for?"</div><div class="paragraph">The boy said, "I didn't aim to."</div><div class="paragraph">She said, "You a lie!"</div><div class="paragraph">By that time two or three people passed, stopped, turned to look, and some stood watching.</div><div class="paragraph">"If I turn you loose, will you run?" asked the woman.</div><div class="paragraph">"Yes'm," said the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Then I won't turn you loose," said the woman. She did not release him.</div><div class="paragraph">"Lady, I'm sorry," whispered the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Um-hum! Your face is dirty. I got a great mind to wash your face for you. Ain't you got nobody home to tell you to wash your face?"</div><div class="paragraph">"No'm," said the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Then it will get washed this evening," said the large woman, starting up the street, dragging the frightened boy behind her.</div><div class="paragraph">He looked as if he were fourteen or fifteen, frail and willow-wild, in tennis shoes and blue jeans.</div><div class="paragraph">The woman said, "You ought to be my son. I would teach you right from wrong. Least I can do right now is to wash your face. Are you hungry?"</div><div class="paragraph">"No'm," said the being-dragged boy. "I just want you to turn me loose."</div><div class="paragraph">"Was I bothering <span class="stressed_text_2">you</span> when I turned that corner?" asked the woman.</div><div class="paragraph">"No'm."</div><div class="paragraph">"But you put yourself in contact with <span class="stressed_text_2">me</span>," said the woman. "If you think that contact is not going to last awhile, you got another thought coming. When I get through with you, sir, you are going to remember Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones."</div><div class="paragraph">Sweat popped out on the boy's face and he began to struggle. Mrs. Jones stopped, jerked him around in front of her, put a half nelson about his neck, and continued to drag him up the street. When she got to her door, she dragged the boy inside, down a hall, and into a large kitchenette-furnished room at the rear of the house. She switched on the light and left the door open. The boy could hear other roomers laughing and talking in the large house. Some of their doors were open, too, so he knew he and the woman were not alone. The woman still had him by the neck in the middle of her room.</div><div class="paragraph">She said, "What is your name?"</div><div class="paragraph">"Roger," answered the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Then, Roger, you go to that sink and wash your face," said the woman, whereupon she turned him loose—at last. Roger looked at the door—looked at the woman—looked at the door—<span class="stressed_text_2">and went to the sink</span>.</div><div class="paragraph">"Let the water run until it gets warm," she said. "Here's a clean towel."</div><div class="paragraph">"You gonna take me to jail?" asked the boy, bending over the sink.</div><div class="paragraph">"Not with that face, I would not take you nowhere," said the woman. "Here I am trying to get home to cook me a bite to eat, and you snatch my pocketbook! Maybe you ain't been to your supper either, late as it be. Have you?"</div><div class="paragraph">"There's nobody home at my house," said the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Then we'll eat," said the woman. "I believe you're hungry—or been hungry—to try to snatch my pocketbook!"</div><div class="paragraph">"I want a pair of blue suede shoes," said the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Well, you didn't have to snatch <span class="stressed_text_2">my</span> pocketbook to get some suede shoes," said Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones. "You could've asked me."</div><div class="paragraph">"M'am?"</div><div class="paragraph">The water dripping from his face, the boy looked at her. There was a long pause. A very long pause. After he had dried his face and not knowing what else to do, dried it again, the boy turned around, wondering what next. The door was open. He could make a dash for it down the hall. He could run, run, run, <span class="stressed_text_2">run</span>!</div><div class="paragraph">The woman was sitting on the daybed. After a while she said, "I were young once and I wanted things I could not get."</div><div class="paragraph">There was another long pause. The boy's mouth opened. Then he frowned, not knowing he frowned.</div><div class="paragraph">The woman said, "Um-hum! You thought I was going to say <span class="stressed_text_2">but</span> didn't you? You thought I was going to say, <span class="stressed_text_2">but I didn't snatch people's pocketbooks</span>. Well, I wasn't going to say that." Pause. Silence. "I have done things, too, which I would not tell you, son. Everybody's got something in common. So you set down while I fix us something to eat. You might run that comb through your hair so you will look presentable."</div><div class="paragraph">In another corner of the room behind a screen was a gas plate and an icebox. Mrs. Jones got up and went behind the screen. The woman did not watch the boy to see if he was going to run now, nor did she watch her purse, which she left behind her on the daybed. But the boy took care to sit on the far side of the room, away from the purse, where he thought she could easily see him out of the corner of her eye if she wanted to. He did not trust the woman not to trust him. And he did not want to be mistrusted now.</div><div class="paragraph">"Do you need somebody to go to the store," asked the boy, "maybe to get some milk or something?"</div><div class="paragraph">"Don't believe I do," said the woman, "unless you just want sweet milk yourself. I was going to make cocoa out of this canned milk I got here."</div><div class="paragraph">"That will be fine," said the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">She heated some lima beans and ham she had in the icebox, made the cocoa, and set the table. The woman did not ask the boy anything about where he lived, or his folks, or anything else that would embarrass him. Instead, as they ate, she told him about her job in a hotel beauty shop that stayed open late, what the work was like, and how all kinds of women came in and out, blondes, redheads, and Spanish. Then she cut him a half of her ten-cent cake.</div><div class="paragraph">"Eat some more, son," she said.</div><div class="paragraph">When they were finished eating, she got up and said, "Now here, take this ten dollars and buy yourself some blue suede shoes. And next time, do not make the mistake of latching onto <span class="stressed_text_2">my</span> pocketbook <span class="stressed_text_2">nor nobody else's</span>. I got to get my rest now. But from here on in, son, I hope you will behave yourself."</div><div class="paragraph">She led him down the hall to the front door and opened it. "Good night! Behave yourself, boy!" she said, looking out into the street as he went down the steps.</div><div class="paragraph">The boy wanted to say something other than, "Thank you, m'am,"to Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones, but although his lips moved, he couldn't even say that as he turned at the foot of the barren stoop and looked up at the large woman in the door. Then she shut the door.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><span class="stressed_text_1">"Thank You M'am" from SHORT STORIES by Langston Hughes. Copyright © 1996 by Ramona Bass and Arnold Rampersad.

Then she said, "Now ain't you ashamed of yourself?"</div><div class="paragraph">Firmly gripped by his shirtfront, the boy said, "Yes'm."</div><div class="paragraph">The woman said, "What did you want to do it for?"</div><div class="paragraph">The boy said, "I didn't aim to."</div><div class="paragraph">She said, "You a lie!"</div><div class="paragraph">By that time two or three people passed, stopped, turned to look, and some stood watching.</div><div class="paragraph">"If I turn you loose, will you run?" asked the woman.</div><div class="paragraph">"Yes'm," said the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Then I won't turn you loose," said the woman. She did not release him.</div><div class="paragraph">"Lady, I'm sorry," whispered the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Um-hum! Your face is dirty. I got a great mind to wash your face for you. Ain't you got nobody home to tell you to wash your face?"</div><div class="paragraph">"No'm," said the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Then it will get washed this evening," said the large woman, starting up the street, dragging the frightened boy behind her.</div><div class="paragraph">He looked as if he were fourteen or fifteen, frail and willow-wild, in tennis shoes and blue jeans.</div><div class="paragraph">The woman said, "You ought to be my son. I would teach you right from wrong. Least I can do right now is to wash your face. Are you hungry?"</div><div class="paragraph">"No'm," said the being-dragged boy. "I just want you to turn me loose."</div><div class="paragraph">"Was I bothering <span class="stressed_text_2">you</span> when I turned that corner?" asked the woman.</div><div class="paragraph">"No'm."</div><div class="paragraph">"But you put yourself in contact with <span class="stressed_text_2">me</span>," said the woman. "If you think that contact is not going to last awhile, you got another thought coming. When I get through with you, sir, you are going to remember Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones."</div><div class="paragraph">Sweat popped out on the boy's face and he began to struggle. Mrs. Jones stopped, jerked him around in front of her, put a half nelson about his neck, and continued to drag him up the street. When she got to her door, she dragged the boy inside, down a hall, and into a large kitchenette-furnished room at the rear of the house. She switched on the light and left the door open. The boy could hear other roomers laughing and talking in the large house. Some of their doors were open, too, so he knew he and the woman were not alone. The woman still had him by the neck in the middle of her room.</div><div class="paragraph">She said, "What is your name?"</div><div class="paragraph">"Roger," answered the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Then, Roger, you go to that sink and wash your face," said the woman, whereupon she turned him loose—at last. Roger looked at the door—looked at the woman—looked at the door—<span class="stressed_text_2">and went to the sink</span>.</div><div class="paragraph">"Let the water run until it gets warm," she said. "Here's a clean towel."</div><div class="paragraph">"You gonna take me to jail?" asked the boy, bending over the sink.</div><div class="paragraph">"Not with that face, I would not take you nowhere," said the woman. "Here I am trying to get home to cook me a bite to eat, and you snatch my pocketbook! Maybe you ain't been to your supper either, late as it be. Have you?"</div><div class="paragraph">"There's nobody home at my house," said the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Then we'll eat," said the woman. "I believe you're hungry—or been hungry—to try to snatch my pocketbook!"</div><div class="paragraph">"I want a pair of blue suede shoes," said the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">"Well, you didn't have to snatch <span class="stressed_text_2">my</span> pocketbook to get some suede shoes," said Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones. "You could've asked me."</div><div class="paragraph">"M'am?"</div><div class="paragraph">The water dripping from his face, the boy looked at her. There was a long pause. A very long pause. After he had dried his face and not knowing what else to do, dried it again, the boy turned around, wondering what next. The door was open. He could make a dash for it down the hall. He could run, run, run, <span class="stressed_text_2">run</span>!</div><div class="paragraph">The woman was sitting on the daybed. After a while she said, "I were young once and I wanted things I could not get."</div><div class="paragraph">There was another long pause. The boy's mouth opened. Then he frowned, not knowing he frowned.</div><div class="paragraph">The woman said, "Um-hum! You thought I was going to say <span class="stressed_text_2">but</span> didn't you? You thought I was going to say, <span class="stressed_text_2">but I didn't snatch people's pocketbooks</span>. Well, I wasn't going to say that." Pause. Silence. "I have done things, too, which I would not tell you, son. Everybody's got something in common. So you set down while I fix us something to eat. You might run that comb through your hair so you will look presentable."</div><div class="paragraph">In another corner of the room behind a screen was a gas plate and an icebox. Mrs. Jones got up and went behind the screen. The woman did not watch the boy to see if he was going to run now, nor did she watch her purse, which she left behind her on the daybed. But the boy took care to sit on the far side of the room, away from the purse, where he thought she could easily see him out of the corner of her eye if she wanted to. He did not trust the woman not to trust him. And he did not want to be mistrusted now.</div><div class="paragraph">"Do you need somebody to go to the store," asked the boy, "maybe to get some milk or something?"</div><div class="paragraph">"Don't believe I do," said the woman, "unless you just want sweet milk yourself. I was going to make cocoa out of this canned milk I got here."</div><div class="paragraph">"That will be fine," said the boy.</div><div class="paragraph">She heated some lima beans and ham she had in the icebox, made the cocoa, and set the table. The woman did not ask the boy anything about where he lived, or his folks, or anything else that would embarrass him. Instead, as they ate, she told him about her job in a hotel beauty shop that stayed open late, what the work was like, and how all kinds of women came in and out, blondes, redheads, and Spanish. Then she cut him a half of her ten-cent cake.</div><div class="paragraph">"Eat some more, son," she said.</div><div class="paragraph">When they were finished eating, she got up and said, "Now here, take this ten dollars and buy yourself some blue suede shoes. And next time, do not make the mistake of latching onto <span class="stressed_text_2">my</span> pocketbook <span class="stressed_text_2">nor nobody else's</span>. I got to get my rest now. But from here on in, son, I hope you will behave yourself."</div><div class="paragraph">She led him down the hall to the front door and opened it. "Good night! Behave yourself, boy!" she said, looking out into the street as he went down the steps.</div><div class="paragraph">The boy wanted to say something other than, "Thank you, m'am,"to Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones, but although his lips moved, he couldn't even say that as he turned at the foot of the barren stoop and looked up at the large woman in the door. Then she shut the door.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><span class="stressed_text_1">"Thank You M'am" from SHORT STORIES by Langston Hughes. Copyright © 1996 by Ramona Bass and Arnold Rampersad.

It had a long strap, and she carried it slung across her shoulder. It was about eleven o'clock at night, dark, and she was walking alone, when a boy ran up behind her and tried to snatch her purse. The strap broke with a sudden single tug the boy gave it from behind. But the boy's weight and the weight of the purse combined caused him to lose his balance. Instead of taking off full blast as he had hoped, the boy fell on his back on the sidewalk and his legs flew up. The large woman simply turned around and kicked him right square in his blue-jeaned sitter. Then she reached down, picked the boy up by his shirtfront, and shook him until his teeth rattled.</div><div class="paragraph">After that the woman said, "Pick up my pocketbook, boy, and give it here."</div><div class="paragraph">She still held him tightly.

Instead of answering her, he slipped deeper into the tall weeds behind his house. He closed his eyes, thinking of what he had done.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"> He had gotten up that morning in a good mood. Raspberry pancakes were on the table when he walked into the kitchen rubbing his eyes and yawning.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"After breakfast, Jason, I want you to go into town with me," Mom said quietly. "It's your sister's birthday, and we need to shop for her gifts."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason was eager to go, even if the gifts weren't for him. Buying presents was always fun.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">As they drove to town, Jason couldn't help but ask the question that had been on his mind since yesterday when Aunt Nancy came. "What's in the big box that Dad took to the barn, Mom? Is it something Aunt Nancy bought for Megan's birthday?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"It's a surprise, Jason, and I don't want you going near that barn today. Do you hear me?"</div><div class="paragraph"><table style="background-color:#f0f0f0" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="800" align="center"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(42)" alt="Picture of a dog walking in front of a cardboard box turned on its side with the flaps open." title="Picture of a dog walking in front of a cardboard box turned on its side with the flaps open." height="167" width="400" class="inln_img" align="bottom"></td><td><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(43)" alt="Picture of a boy standing in front of a barn next to a cardboard box turned on its side with the flaps open." title="Picture of a boy standing in front of a barn next to a cardboard box turned on its side with the flaps open." height="293" width="400" align="middle"></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason sat staring at the road ahead. He knew that nothing would change her mind. Only now he was more curious than ever!</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Back home, Megan ran out to meet Jason, her eyes wide and excited. "Jason, Jason, I'm six years old!" she cried, jumping up and down.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"I know, I know." Jason gave her a big hug.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Soon the house was buzzing with excitement. Megan sat on the stool watching while Mom and Aunt Nancy prepared the birthday dinner. Dad wouldn't be back for at least two hours. Jason wandered outside trying to think of something to do, but his thoughts kept returning to the box in the barn.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">He started walking toward the barn, not at all sure what he'd do when he got there. He was hoping for just a glimpse of the box. Instead he heard a strange noise coming from inside the barn. He wished he could just turn back to the house, but his legs carried him into the barn. Jason saw the box. It was sitting between two bales of hay. He could hear loud wailing cries. Leaning over, Jason carefully lifted the lid. There was the most cuddly puppy he had ever seen!</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"You must be pretty scared, huh, fellow?" Jason said quietly as he held the wiggly dog. "Megan's going to love you!" He secretly wished the puppy was for him. After all, Mom and Dad knew that he had been wanting his own puppy. Probably Aunt Nancy didn't know that, and anyway Megan would be happy.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Soon Jason was playing happily with the puppy, and he forgot that he wasn't supposed to be in the barn. Taffy, their big brown horse, stuck his head in the window as if to say, "What's going on?" Jason jumped, remembering that he wasn't supposed to be there. The puppy ran off as fast as it could out of the barn and into the field.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason stumbled out of the barn looking wildly for any trace of the puppy.

He'd looked everywhere, but the puppy was gone. He had ruined his sister's birthday.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Jason! It's time for dinner!" Mom called even louder now. Just when he was determined to stay forever in the tall weeds, he heard his sister's voice.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Jason! It's time for my party, Jason!" Megan yelled excitedly.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason rubbed his swollen eyes, trying to look normal. He couldn't ruin everything for her. "I'm here, Megan," he called.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Are you OK?" she asked with genuine concern.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Sure. Let's hurry." Jason grabbed her hand as they ran back.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">As soon as they reached the house, the party began. Jason tried to pretend that everything was fine. When it was time to open Megan's birthday gifts, he sat in the big easy chair, hoping no one would notice him. Finally the last present was open.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"I'll be right back," Dad said.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason knew Dad was going to the barn. Megan would probably never forgive him for losing her birthday puppy.

It was Dad calling from the front yard.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason slowly got out of the chair.

Mom and Aunt Nancy followed close behind.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">There was Dad standing with the box next to him in the grass. "Jason, I want you to open this box and see what's inside."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason looked up and saw that Dad was smiling. He turned and saw that Mom, Aunt Nancy, and Megan were smiling, too. What would he say to them when there was nothing in the box? But as Jason looked down, expecting to see nothing at all, he jumped back in surprise. The puppy looked up at him with sleepy eyes.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Wow!" said Jason, bewildered.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"The puppy's for you, Son," his father said.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"I thought you'd like a gift, too, even if it isn't your birthday," said Aunt Nancy, laughing.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Megan started clapping.

Instead of answering her, he slipped deeper into the tall weeds behind his house.

Raspberry pancakes were on the table when he walked into the kitchen rubbing his eyes and yawning.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"After breakfast, Jason, I want you to go into town with me," Mom said quietly. "It's your sister's birthday, and we need to shop for her gifts."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason was eager to go, even if the gifts weren't for him. Buying presents was always fun.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">As they drove to town, Jason couldn't help but ask the question that had been on his mind since yesterday when Aunt Nancy came.

He knew that nothing would change her mind. Only now he was more curious than ever!</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Back home, Megan ran out to meet Jason, her eyes wide and excited. "Jason, Jason, I'm six years old!" she cried, jumping up and down.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"I know, I know." Jason gave her a big hug.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Soon the house was buzzing with excitement. Megan sat on the stool watching while Mom and Aunt Nancy prepared the birthday dinner. Dad wouldn't be back for at least two hours. Jason wandered outside trying to think of something to do, but his thoughts kept returning to the box in the barn.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">He started walking toward the barn, not at all sure what he'd do when he got there. He was hoping for just a glimpse of the box. Instead he heard a strange noise coming from inside the barn. He wished he could just turn back to the house, but his legs carried him into the barn. Jason saw the box. It was sitting between two bales of hay. He could hear loud wailing cries. Leaning over, Jason carefully lifted the lid. There was the most cuddly puppy he had ever seen!</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"You must be pretty scared, huh, fellow?" Jason said quietly as he held the wiggly dog. "Megan's going to love you!" He secretly wished the puppy was for him. After all, Mom and Dad knew that he had been wanting his own puppy. Probably Aunt Nancy didn't know that, and anyway Megan would be happy.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Soon Jason was playing happily with the puppy, and he forgot that he wasn't supposed to be in the barn. Taffy, their big brown horse, stuck his head in the window as if to say, "What's going on?" Jason jumped, remembering that he wasn't supposed to be there. The puppy ran off as fast as it could out of the barn and into the field.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason stumbled out of the barn looking wildly for any trace of the puppy. "Come on, puppy! Oh, please come here!" he called, his eyes welling up with tears.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="font-size:25px"><span class="stressed_text_1">N</span></span>ow here he was, two hours later, hiding in the weeds. He'd looked everywhere, but the puppy was gone. He had ruined his sister's birthday.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Jason! It's time for dinner!" Mom called even louder now. Just when he was determined to stay forever in the tall weeds, he heard his sister's voice.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Jason! It's time for my party, Jason!" Megan yelled excitedly.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason rubbed his swollen eyes, trying to look normal. He couldn't ruin everything for her. "I'm here, Megan," he called.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Are you OK?" she asked with genuine concern.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Sure. Let's hurry." Jason grabbed her hand as they ran back.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">As soon as they reached the house, the party began. Jason tried to pretend that everything was fine. When it was time to open Megan's birthday gifts, he sat in the big easy chair, hoping no one would notice him. Finally the last present was open.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"I'll be right back," Dad said.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason knew Dad was going to the barn. Megan would probably never forgive him for losing her birthday puppy. Everyone, even Aunt Nancy, would be angry when they found out the puppy was gone.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Jason! Come here!" It was Dad calling from the front yard.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason slowly got out of the chair. It was hard to move, but Megan grabbed his hand and said, "Come on, Jason! Let's see what Dad wants."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason followed Megan out the door. Mom and Aunt Nancy followed close behind.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">There was Dad standing with the box next to him in the grass. "Jason, I want you to open this box and see what's inside."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Jason looked up and saw that Dad was smiling. He turned and saw that Mom, Aunt Nancy, and Megan were smiling, too. What would he say to them when there was nothing in the box? But as Jason looked down, expecting to see nothing at all, he jumped back in surprise. The puppy looked up at him with sleepy eyes.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"Wow!" said Jason, bewildered.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"The puppy's for you, Son," his father said.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">"I thought you'd like a gift, too, even if it isn't your birthday," said Aunt Nancy, laughing.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Megan started clapping.

Matarić, a Brandeis University computer scientist, believes robots will do their best work only when they begin to work together. "How do you get a herd of robots to do something without killing each other?" she asks. According to Matarić, you have to put them in societies and let them learn from one another, just as seagulls and baboons and people do. Matarić has already made an impressive start at teaching robots social skills. She has gotten 14 robots to cooperate at once—the biggest gaggle of machines ever to socialize.</div><div class="paragraph">  The Nerd Herd, as Matarić calls them, are shoe-box-size machines, each of which has four wheels, two tongs to grab things, and a two-way radio. The radio allows them to triangulate their position with respect to two fixed transmitters as they wander around Matarić's lab. It also allows them to broadcast their coordinates and other information to their neighbors. Infrared sensors help the robots find things and avoid obstacles; contact-sensitive strips tell them when they've crashed anyway.</div><div class="paragraph">  Each robot is programmed with a handful of what Matarić calls behaviors—sets of instructions that enable the robot to accomplish a small goal, like following the robot in front of it. Set one robot on the floor with its wheels turned permanently to the left and program the others to follow, and they will all drive in a circle until their batteries go dead. But Matarić can get more interesting actions out of the herd by programming them to alternate among several behaviors. By telling them to home in on a target, to aggregate when they're too far from one another, to disperse when they're too crowded and to avoid collisions at all times, she's been able to get scattered robots to come together and migrate across her lab like a flock of birds.</div><div class="paragraph">  More important, the robots can also learn on their own to carry out more complex tasks. One task Matarić set for them was to forage for little metal pucks and bring them home to their nest in a corner of the lab. To give the task a natural flavor, Matarić gave the robots clocks; at "night"they had to go home and rest, and in the "morning" they looked for pucks again. In addition to five basic behaviors they could choose from, she endowed them with a sort of prime directive: to maximize their individual point scores. Each time a robot did something right, such as locating a puck, it was automatically rewarded with points; each time it committed a blooper, such as dropping a puck, it lost points.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" align="center"><div class="stdaln_img"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(44)" alt="Drawing of the Sharebots robot" title="Drawing of the Sharebots robot" height="293" width="273" class="inln_img"></div><span class="stressed_text_1">Matarić's Nerd Herd, with the pucks they now pursue collectively.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">  After some random experimentation, the robots soon learned how to forage but not very well, because they tended to interfere with one another in their selfish pursuit of points. "Why should you ever stop and let someone else go?" asks Matarić. "It's always in your interest to go but if everybody feels that way, then nobody gets through and they jam up and fight for space."To make her creatures more efficient, though, Matarić found she didn't have to program them with a God's-eye view of what was good for all robots. She just had to teach each robot to share to let other robots know when it had found a puck, and to listen to other robots in return. "I put in the impetus to pay attention to what other robots are doing, and to try what other robots are trying, sharing the experience," Matarić explains. "If I do some thing that's good and if I say, 'That was really great,' then you may try it."</div><div class="paragraph">  With this simple social contract, the robots needed only 15 minutes of practice to become altruistic. They would magnanimously announce their discovery of pucks, despite having no way of knowing that this was good for the herd as a whole. At times when two robots lunged for a puck, they would stop and go through an "After you!" "No, after you!" routine, but eventually they figured out the proper way to yield. With social graces, the robot herd brought home the pucks twice as fast as without.</div><div class="paragraph">  Matarić thinks she'll be able to produce more complex robot societies. "I'm looking at getting specialization in the society so they can say, 'I'll do this, and you do that.' If one of them has a low battery, it may become the messenger that doesn't actually carry things. And I imagine one robot might emerge as a leader because it happens to be the most efficient. But if it stops being efficient, some other robot will take over."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center; font-size:8px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Carl Zimmer © 1995 The Walt Disney Co.

In addition to five basic behaviors they could choose from, she endowed them with a sort of prime directive: to maximize their individual point scores.

Matarić, a Brandeis University computer scientist, believes robots will do their best work only when they begin to work together. "How do you get a herd of robots to do something without killing each other?" she asks. According to Matarić, you have to put them in societies and let them learn from one another, just as seagulls and baboons and people do. Matarić has already made an impressive start at teaching robots social skills. She has gotten 14 robots to cooperate at once—the biggest gaggle of machines ever to socialize.</div><div class="paragraph">  The Nerd Herd, as Matarić calls them, are shoe-box-size machines, each of which has four wheels, two tongs to grab things, and a two-way radio. The radio allows them to triangulate their position with respect to two fixed transmitters as they wander around Matarić's lab. It also allows them to broadcast their coordinates and other information to their neighbors. Infrared sensors help the robots find things and avoid obstacles; contact-sensitive strips tell them when they've crashed anyway.</div><div class="paragraph">  Each robot is programmed with a handful of what Matarić calls behaviors—sets of instructions that enable the robot to accomplish a small goal, like following the robot in front of it. Set one robot on the floor with its wheels turned permanently to the left and program the others to follow, and they will all drive in a circle until their batteries go dead. But Matarić can get more interesting actions out of the herd by programming them to alternate among several behaviors. By telling them to home in on a target, to aggregate when they're too far from one another, to disperse when they're too crowded and to avoid collisions at all times, she's been able to get scattered robots to come together and migrate across her lab like a flock of birds.</div><div class="paragraph">  More important, the robots can also learn on their own to carry out more complex tasks.

I can assure you that you will observe a vast wasteland.</span></div><hr class="responseline"> <div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">Newton Minow (1926–    ) was appointed by President John Kennedy as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the agency responsible for regulating the use of the public airwaves. On May 9, 1961, he spoke to 2,000 members of the National Association of Broadcasters and told them that the daily fare on television was "a vast wasteland." Minow's indictment of commercial television launched a national debate about the quality of programming. After Minow's speech, the television critic for <span class="stressed_text_2">The New York Times</span> wrote: "Tonight some broadcasters were trying to find dark explanations for Mr. Minow's attitude. In this matter the viewer possibly can be a little helpful; Mr. Minow has been watching television."</span></div><hr class="responseline"> <div class="paragraph">   . . . <span class="font-size:20px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Y</span></span>our industry possesses the most powerful voice in America. It has an inescapable duty to make that voice ring with intelligence and with leadership. In a few years this exciting industry has grown from a novelty to an instrument of overwhelming impact on the American people. It should be making ready for the kind of leadership that newspapers and magazines assumed years ago, to make our people aware of their world.</div><div class="paragraph">   Ours has been called the jet age, the atomic age, the space age. It is also, I submit, the television age. And just as history will decide whether the leaders of today's world employed the atom to destroy the world or rebuild it for mankind's benefit, so will history decide whether today's broadcasters employed their powerful voice to enrich the people or debase them. . . .</div><div class="paragraph">   Like everybody, I wear more than one hat. I am the chairman of the FCC. I am also a television viewer and the husband and father of other television viewers. I have seen a great many television programs that seemed to me eminently worthwhile, and I am not talking about the much-bemoaned good old days of "Playhouse 90" and "Studio One."</div><div class="paragraph">   I am talking about this past season. Some were wonderfully entertaining, such as "The Fabulous Fifties," the "Fred Astaire Show" and the "Bing Crosby Special"; some were dramatic and moving, such as Conrad's "Victory" and "Twilight Zone"; some were marvelously informative, such as "The Nation's Future," "CBS Reports," and "The Valiant Years." I could list many more—programs that I am sure everyone here felt enriched his own life and that of his family. When television is good, nothing—not the theater, not the magazines or newspapers—nothing is better.</div><div class="paragraph">   But when television is bad, nothing is worse. I invite you to sit down in front of your television set when your station goes on the air and stay there without a book, magazine, newspaper, profit-and-loss sheet, or rating book to distract you—and keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off. I can assure you that you will observe a vast wasteland.</div><div class="paragraph">   You will see a procession of game shows, violence, audience participation shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, Western badmen, Western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence and cartoons. And, endlessly, commercials—many screaming, cajoling, and offending. And, most of all, boredom. True, you will see a few things you will enjoy. But they will be very, very few. And if you think I exaggerate, try it.</div><div class="paragraph">   Is there one person in this room who claims that broadcasting can't do better?. . .</div><div class="paragraph">   Why is so much of television so bad? I have heard many answers: demands of your advertisers; competition for ever higher ratings; the need always to attract a mass audience; the high cost of television programs; the insatiable appetite for programming material—these are some of them. Unquestionably these are tough problems not susceptible to easy answers.</div><div class="paragraph">   But I am not convinced that you have tried hard enough to solve them. I do not accept the idea that the present overall programming is aimed accurately at the public taste. The ratings tell us only that some people have their television sets turned on, and, of that number, so many are tuned to one channel and so many to another. They don't tell us what the public might watch if they were offered half a dozen additional choices. A rating, at best, is an indication of how many people saw what you gave them. Unfortunately it does not reveal the depth of the penetration or the intensity of reaction, and it never reveals what the acceptance would have been if what you gave them had been better—if all the forces of art and creativity and daring and imagination had been unleashed. I believe in the people's good sense and good taste, and I am not convinced that the people's taste is as low as some of you assume. . . .</div><div class="paragraph">   Certainly I hope you will agree that ratings should have little influence where children are concerned. The best estimates indicate that during the hours of 5 to 6 p.m., 60 percent of your audience is composed of children under twelve. And most young children today, believe it or not, spend as much time watching television as they do in the schoolroom. I repeat—let that sink in—most young children today spend as much time watching television as they do in the schoolroom. It used to be said that there were three great influences on a child: home, school and church. Today there is a fourth great influence, and you ladies and gentlemen control it.</div><div class="paragraph">   If parents, teachers, and ministers conducted their responsibilities by following the ratings, children would have a steady diet of ice cream, school holidays, and no Sunday school. What about your responsibilities? Is there no room on television to teach, to inform, to uplift, to stretch, to enlarge the capacities of our children? Is there no room for programs deepening their understanding of children in other lands? Is there no room for a children's news show explaining something about the world to them at their level of understanding? Is there no room for reading the great literature of the past, teaching them the great traditions of freedom? There are some fine children's shows, but they are drowned out in the massive doses of cartoons, violence, and more violence. Must these be your trademarks? Search your consciences and see if you cannot offer more to your young beneficiaries whose future you guide so many hours each and every day.</div><div class="paragraph">   What about adult programming and ratings? You know, newspaper publishers take popularity ratings too. The answers are pretty clear; it is almost always the comics, followed by the advice-to-the-lovelorn columns. But, ladies and gentlemen, the news is still on the front page of all newspapers, the editorials are not replaced by more comics, the newspapers have not become one long collection of advice to the lovelorn. Yet newspapers do not need a license from the government to be in business—they do not use public property. But in television—where your responsibilities as public trustees are so plain—the moment that the ratings indicate that Westerns are popular, there are new imitations of Westerns on the air faster than the old coaxial cable could take us from Hollywood to New York. . . .</div><div class="paragraph">   Let me make clear that what I am talking about is balance. I believe that the public interest is made up of many interests. There are many people in this great country, and you must serve all of us. You will get no argument from me if you say that, given a choice between a Western and a symphony, more people will watch the Western. I like Westerns and private eyes too—but a steady diet for the whole country is obviously not in the public interest. We all know that people would more often prefer to be entertained than stimulated or informed. But your obligations are not satisfied if you look only to popularity as a test of what to broadcast. You are not only in show business; you are free to communicate ideas as well as relaxation. You must provide a wider range of choices, more diversity, more alternatives. It is not enough to cater to the nation's whims—you must also serve the nation's needs. . . .</div><div class="paragraph">   Let me address myself now to my role, not as a viewer but as chairman of the FCC. . .I want to make clear some of the fundamental principles which guide me.</div><div class="paragraph">   First, the people own the air. They own it as much in prime evening time as they do at 6 o'clock Sunday morning. For every hour that the people give you, you owe them something. I intend to see that your debt is paid with service.</div><div class="paragraph">   Second, I think it would be foolish and wasteful for us to continue any worn-out wrangle over the problems of payola, rigged quiz shows, and other mistakes of the past. . . .</div><div class="paragraph">   Third, I believe in the free enterprise system. I want to see broadcasting improved and I want you to do the job. . . .</div><div class="paragraph">   Fourth, I will do all I can to help educational television. There are still not enough educational stations, and major centers of the country still lack usable educational channels. . . .</div><div class="paragraph">   Fifth, I am unalterably opposed to governmental censorship. There will be no suppression of programming which does not meet with bureaucratic tastes. Censorship strikes at the taproot of our free society.</div><div class="paragraph">   Sixth, I did not come to Washington to idly observe the squandering of the public's airwaves. The squandering of our airwaves is no less important than the lavish waste of any precious natural resource . . . .</div><div class="paragraph">   What you gentlemen broadcast through the people's air affects the people's taste, their knowledge, their opinions, their understanding of themselves and of their world. And their future. The power of instantaneous sight and sound is without precedent in mankind's history. This is an awesome power. It has limitless capabilities for good—and for evil. And it carries with it awesome responsibilities—responsibilities which you and I cannot escape....</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><br>220. <div class="paragraph">Mr. Minow mainly supported his position with</div></div><div class="distractors"><div>A. <span class="itemtext"><span>personal opinions</span></span></div>

Frame</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1"><span class="font-size:144%">N</span></span>early every day last summer my nephew Keith and I went crabbing in a creek on the New Jersey coast. We used a wire trap baited with scraps of fish and meat. Each time a crab entered the trap to eat, we pulled the doors closed. We cooked and ate the crabs we caught.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Blue crabs are very strong. Their big claws can make a painful pinch. When cornered, the crabs boldly defend themselves. They wave their outstretched claws and are fast and ready to fight. Keith and I had to be very careful to avoid having our fingers pinched.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Crabs are <span class="stressed_text_1">arthropods</span>, a very large group of animals that have an external skeleton and jointed legs. Other kinds of arthropods are insects, spiders, and centipedes. Blue crabs belong to a particular arthropod group called <span class="stressed_text_1">crustaceans</span>. Crustaceans are abundant in the ocean, just as insects are on land.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The blue crab's hard shell is a strong armor. But the armor must be cast off from time to time so the crab can grow bigger. Getting rid of its shell is called <span class="stressed_text_1">molting</span>.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Each blue crab molts about twenty times during its life. Just before molting, a new soft shell forms under the hard outer shell. Then the outer shell splits apart, and the crab backs out. This leaves the crab with a soft, wrinkled, outer covering. The body increases in size by absorbing water, stretching the soft shell to a much larger size. The crab hides for a few hours until its new shell has hardened.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Keith and I sometimes found these soft-shell crabs clinging to pilings and hiding beneath seaweed.</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1"><span class="font-size:144%">B</span></span>lue crabs mate when the female undergoes her last molt and still has a soft shell. The male courts her by dancing from side to side while holding his claws</div><div class="paragraph"><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center"><div class="stdaln_img"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(48)" alt="Crabs" title="Crabs" height="387" width="299" class="inln_img"></div></div></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">outstretched. He then transfers sperm to the female, where they are stored until egg laying begins several months later. The female blue crab mates only once but receives enough sperm to fertilize all the eggs that she will lay in her lifetime. Usually she lays eggs two or three times during the summer, and then she dies.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">When the eggs are fertilized and laid, they become glued to long hairs on the underside of the female's abdomen. The egg mass sometimes looks like an orange-brown sponge and contains up to two million eggs until they hatch — about nine to fourteen days later. Only one of the blue crabs that we caught last summer was carrying eggs, and we returned her to the water so her eggs could hatch. Most females with eggs stay in the deeper, saltier water at the ocean's edge rather than in the marshes.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The young blue crabs, and most other young crustaceans, hatch into larvae that look very different from their parents. The tiny blue crab babies are hardly bigger than a speck of dust. They are transparent and look like they are all head and tail. These larvae swim near the surface of the sea, and grow a new and bigger shell every few days. They soon change in shape so that they can either swim or crawl around on the bottom. Then they molt again and look like tiny adult crabs. After that their appearance does not change, but they continue to molt every twenty or thirty days as they grow.</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1"><span class="font-size:144%">A</span></span>s blue crabs become older, some move into shallower waters. The males in particular go into creeks and marshes, sometimes all the way to the freshwater streams and rivers. Keith and I caught ninety-two blue crabs in the shallow creek of the tide marsh last summer. Eighty-seven of those crabs were males, and only five were females.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Gulls find and eat many blue crabs. They easily catch crabs that hide in puddles at low tide. Other predators are raccoons, alligators, and people. If caught, the crabs sometimes drop off a leg or claw to escape. Seven of the blue crabs that Keith and I caught were missing a claw.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Crabs are able to replace their lost limbs. If a leg or claw is seriously injured, the crab drops it off. The opening that is left near the body closes to prevent the loss of blood. Soon a new limb begins growing at the break. The next time the crab molts, the tiny limb's covering is cast off, too, and the crab then has a new usable leg or claw. The new limb is smaller than the lost one. But by the time the crab molts two or three more times, the new leg or claw will be normal size.</div><div class="paragraph">&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1"><span class="font-size:144%">M</span></span>any fishermen catch crabs to sell. Most are caught in wire traps or with baited lines during the summer while the crabs are active. In the winter, the fishermen drag big nets through the mud for the dormant crabs. Commercial fishermen catch a lot of crabs, sometimes more than 50 million pounds in a year. And many other crabs are caught by weekend fishermen who crab for fun and food.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The blue crab has a scientific name, just like all other living things. Its name is <span class="stressed_text_2">Callinectes sapidus</span>. In the Latin language <span class="stressed_text_2">Callinectes</span> means "beautiful swimmer," and <span class="stressed_text_2">sapidus</span> means "delicious." I think that scientists gave the blue crab a very appropriate name.</div><div class="paragraph">WO000016</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="font-size:80%"><span class="stressed_text_1">Used by permission of Highlights for Children, Inc., Columbus, OH.</span> © 1988.</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="background-color:white" border="0" width="400" align="center"><tbody><tr><td><div class="paragraph">"This material is from the National Assessment of Educational Progress which was funded by a federal government grant.

They first meet when Turtle, famished from traveling a long way from home, comes upon Spider's house. While Spider is well known among his neighbors for his great appetite and his greediness, Turtle, being a stranger, believes Spider's offer of a meal to be sincere. It becomes clear that Spider wants all the food for himself and that his gesture of hospitality is mere show so that people will not speak badly of him. Turtle realizes that he has been tricked out of having any food but doesn't let on that he knows. He suavely concurs with Spider that it was a fine meal; and as Turtle leaves, he assures Spider of similar hospitality if Spider ever visits in his country.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">In time, the gluttonous Spider finds himself a long way from home in Turtle's country. Now it is Turtle's turn to use local custom as a camouflage for true intent.

After several attempts, the servant finally rouses the Emperor to look at the miracle in the sky: a man flying with wings fashioned from paper and bamboo. The emperor is stunned, then demands that the inventor be brought to him.</div><div class="paragraph">The Emperor decrees that the man and his invention be destroyed because the progress symbolized by the flying machine threatens both the Emperor's way of life and the well-being of his people. In order to illustrate his point to the inventor, the Emperor shows an invention of his own that mirrors the natural world: a wind-up box containing small trees and miniature flying birds. The inventor tries to convince the Emperor that his flying machine, like the Emperor's invention, is a thing of beauty. The Emperor, however, chooses to protect the peace of his dominion from the possibility of future invasion, and sacrifices the momentary beauty provided by the flying machine. The story ends with the Emperor enjoying the peaceful miniature world inside his wind-up box.</div>________________________________________<div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">* We did not receive copyright approval to put the actual text from the student booklet on the Website.

It has so many trees that early Spanish explorers called it Mesa Verde, which means "green table."For about eight hundred years Native Americans called the Anasazi lived on this mesa. And then they left. Ever since the cliff houses were first discovered a hundred years ago, scientists and historians have wondered why.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     Anasazi is a Navajo word meaning "the ancient ones." When they first settled there, around 500 A. D., the Anasazi lived in alcoves in the walls of the high canyons. Later they moved to the level land on top, where they built houses of stone and mud mortar. As time passed, they constructed more elaborate houses, like apartment buildings, with several families living close together.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     The Anasazi made beautiful pottery, turquoise jewelry, fine sashes of woven hair, and baskets woven tightly enough to hold water. They lived by hunting and by growing corn and squash. Their way of life went on peacefully for several hundred years.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     Then around 1200 A.D. something strange happened, for which the reasons are not quite clear. Most of the people moved from the level plateau back down into alcoves in the cliffs. The move must have made their lives difficult because they had to climb back up to the plateau to do the farming. But it seems the Anasazi planned to stay in the canyon walls, for they soon filled the alcoves with amazing cliff dwellings. "Cliff Palace," the most famous of these, had more than two hundred rooms.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     For all the hard work that went into building these new homes, the Anasazi did not live in them long. By 1300 A.D. the cliff dwellings were empty. Mesa Verde was deserted and remained a ghost country for almost six hundred years. Were the people driven out of their homes by enemies? No sign of attack or fighting, or even the presence of other tribes, has been found.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     Archaeologists who have studied the place now believe there are other reasons. Mesa Verde, the beautiful green table, was no longer a good place to live. For one thing, in the second half of the thirteenth century there were long periods of cold, and very little rain fell—or else it came at the wrong time of year. Scientists know this from examining the wood used in the cliff dwellings. The growth rings in trees show good and bad growing seasons. But the people had survived drought and bad weather before, so there must have been another reason.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     As the population grew, more land on the mesa top had to be farmed in order to feed the people. That meant that trees had to be cut to clear the land and also to use for houses and fuel. Without the forests, the rain began to wash away the mesa top.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     How do we know about erosion problems that happened about eight hundred years ago? The Anasazi built many low dams across the smaller valleys on the mesa to slow down rain runoff. Even so, good soil washed away, and the people could no longer raise enough food. As the forests dwindled, the animals, already over–hunted, left the mesa for mountainous areas with more trees.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     And as the mesa "wore out," so did the people. It appears that the Anasazi were not healthy. Scientists can learn a lot about ancient people's health by studying the bones and teeth found in burials. The mesa dwellers had arthritis, and their teeth were worn down by the grit in corn meal, a main part of their diet.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     As food became scarce, people grew weaker. Not many lived beyond their twenties. Women died very young, and few babies survived. Living so close together in the cliff houses, where everyone was hungry and worried, the people must have suffered from emotional strain. They probably quarreled often.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     In the end the Anasazi must have given up hope that things would get better. Families packed up and went away. Of course, the "ancient ones" did not simply disappear. They moved southeast to another area and mingled with other peoples. After a while their heritage as the people of the Mesa Verde was forgotten.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     In time the trees grew back and the plateau became green once more. But, for the Anasazi it was too late. Although they respected nature and tried to farm wisely, land that was used too hard could not support them forever.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     Yet in their cliff houses and crafts the "ancient ones" left us a superb monument.

It has so many trees that early Spanish explorers called it Mesa Verde, which means "green table."For about eight hundred years Native Americans called the Anasazi lived on this mesa. And then they left. Ever since the cliff houses were first discovered a hundred years ago, scientists and historians have wondered why.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     Anasazi is a Navajo word meaning "the ancient ones." When they first settled there, around 500 A. D., the Anasazi lived in alcoves in the walls of the high canyons. Later they moved to the level land on top, where they built houses of stone and mud mortar. As time passed, they constructed more elaborate houses, like apartment buildings, with several families living close together.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     The Anasazi made beautiful pottery, turquoise jewelry, fine sashes of woven hair, and baskets woven tightly enough to hold water. They lived by hunting and by growing corn and squash. Their way of life went on peacefully for several hundred years.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     Then around 1200 A.D. something strange happened, for which the reasons are not quite clear. Most of the people moved from the level plateau back down into alcoves in the cliffs. The move must have made their lives difficult because they had to climb back up to the plateau to do the farming. But it seems the Anasazi planned to stay in the canyon walls, for they soon filled the alcoves with amazing cliff dwellings. "Cliff Palace," the most famous of these, had more than two hundred rooms.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     For all the hard work that went into building these new homes, the Anasazi did not live in them long. By 1300 A.D. the cliff dwellings were empty. Mesa Verde was deserted and remained a ghost country for almost six hundred years. Were the people driven out of their homes by enemies? No sign of attack or fighting, or even the presence of other tribes, has been found.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     Archaeologists who have studied the place now believe there are other reasons. Mesa Verde, the beautiful green table, was no longer a good place to live. For one thing, in the second half of the thirteenth century there were long periods of cold, and very little rain fell—or else it came at the wrong time of year. Scientists know this from examining the wood used in the cliff dwellings. The growth rings in trees show good and bad growing seasons. But the people had survived drought and bad weather before, so there must have been another reason.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     As the population grew, more land on the mesa top had to be farmed in order to feed the people. That meant that trees had to be cut to clear the land and also to use for houses and fuel. Without the forests, the rain began to wash away the mesa top.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     How do we know about erosion problems that happened about eight hundred years ago? The Anasazi built many low dams across the smaller valleys on the mesa to slow down rain runoff. Even so, good soil washed away, and the people could no longer raise enough food. As the forests dwindled, the animals, already over–hunted, left the mesa for mountainous areas with more trees.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     And as the mesa "wore out," so did the people. It appears that the Anasazi were not healthy. Scientists can learn a lot about ancient people's health by studying the bones and teeth found in burials. The mesa dwellers had arthritis, and their teeth were worn down by the grit in corn meal, a main part of their diet.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     As food became scarce, people grew weaker. Not many lived beyond their twenties. Women died very young, and few babies survived. Living so close together in the cliff houses, where everyone was hungry and worried, the people must have suffered from emotional strain. They probably quarreled often.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">     In the end the Anasazi must have given up hope that things would get better. Families packed up and went away.

The story recounts the events of a single day and the difficult decision made by a fictional emperor in 5<sup>th</sup> century China.</div><div class="paragraph">While the Emperor is enjoying the tranquility of the morning, a servant rushes in to tell him about a "miracle." After several attempts, the servant finally rouses the Emperor to look at the miracle in the sky: a man flying with wings fashioned from paper and bamboo. The emperor is stunned, then demands that the inventor be brought to him.</div><div class="paragraph">The Emperor decrees that the man and his invention be destroyed because the progress symbolized by the flying machine threatens both the Emperor's way of life and the well-being of his people. In order to illustrate his point to the inventor, the Emperor shows an invention of his own that mirrors the natural world: a wind-up box containing small trees and miniature flying birds. The inventor tries to convince the Emperor that his flying machine, like the Emperor's invention, is a thing of beauty. The Emperor, however, chooses to protect the peace of his dominion from the possibility of future invasion, and sacrifices the momentary beauty provided by the flying machine. The story ends with the Emperor enjoying the peaceful miniature world inside his wind-up box.</div>________________________________________<div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">* We did not receive copyright approval to put the actual text from the student booklet on the Website.

Amanda Clement was sixteen years old. She sat quietly in the grandstand with her mother, but she imagined herself right out there on the baseball diamond with the players. Back home in Hudson, South Dakota, her brother Hank and his friends often asked her to umpire games. Sometimes she was even allowed to play first base.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Mandy, as she was called, could only sit and watch Hank pitch for Renville against Hawarden. The year was 1904, and girls were not supposed to participate in sports. But when the umpire for the preliminary game between two local teams didn't arrive, Hank asked Mandy to make the calls.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Clement didn't want her daughter to umpire a public event, but at last Hank and Mandy persuaded her to give her consent. Mandy eagerly took her position behind the pitcher's mound. Because only one umpire was used in those days, she had to call plays on the four bases as well as strikes and balls.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandy was five feet ten inches tall and looked very impressive as she accurately called the plays. She did so well that the players for the big game asked her to umpire for them — with pay!</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Clement was shocked at that idea. But Mandy finally persuaded her mother to allow her to do it. Amanda Clement became the first paid woman baseball umpire on record.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandy's fame spread quickly. Before long, she was umpiring games in North and South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska. Flyers, sent out to announce upcoming games, called Mandy the "World Champion Woman Umpire." Her uniform was a long blue skirt, a black necktie, and a white blouse with UMPS stenciled across the front. Mandy kept her long dark hair tucked inside a peaked cap. She commanded respect and attention — players never said, "Kill the umpire!" They argued more politely, asking, "Beg your pardon, Miss Umpire, but wasn't that one a bit high?"</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandy is recognized in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York; the Women's Sports Hall of Fame; and Women's Sports foundation in San Francisco, California. In 1912 she held the world record for a woman throwing a baseball: 279 feet.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandy's earning for her work as an umpire came in especially handy. She put herself through college and became a teacher and coach, organizing teams and encouraging athletes wherever she lived. Mandy died in 1971. People who knew her remember her for her work as an umpire, teacher, and coach, and because she loved helping people as much as she loved sports.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:8pt;line-height:95%">"Amanda Clement: The Umpire in a Skirt", by Marilyn Kratz.

Lights had not flared up at the sound of Star's hoofbeats. Sybil had not anticipated this. Biting her lower lip, she pulled Star to a halt.

Sybil's ears strained for sounds of other riders who might try to steal her horse or stop her mission. Twice she pulled Star off the path while unknown riders passed within a few feet. Both times, her fright dried her mouth and made her hands tremble.</div><div class="paragraph">     By the time they reached Stormville, Star had stumbled several times, and Sybil's voice was almost gone.

As commander of the only colonial army regiment between Danbury, Connecticut, and Peekskill, New York, Sybil's father did not have much time to be with his family.</div><div class="paragraph">     Thudding hooves in the yard abruptly ended their meal. The colonel pushed back his chair and strode to the door. Although Sybil followed him with her eyes, she dutifully began to help her sister Rebecca clear the table.</div><div class="paragraph">     The girls were washing dishes when their father burst back into the room with a courier at his side.</div><div class="paragraph">     "Here, Seth," said the colonel, "sit you down and have some supper. Rebecca, see to our weary friend."</div><div class="paragraph">     Sybil, glancing over her shoulder, saw that the stranger was no older than she. A familiar flame of indignation burned her cheeks. Being a girl kept her from being a soldier!</div><div class="paragraph">     Across the room, her parents were talking together in low tones. Her father's voice rose.</div><div class="paragraph">     "Sybil, leave the dishes and come here," he said.</div><div class="paragraph">     Obeying quickly, she overheard her father as he again spoke to her mother.</div><div class="paragraph">     "Abigail, she is a skilled rider. It is Sybil who has trained Star, and the horse will obey her like no other."</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center"><div class="stdaln_img"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(52)" alt="Sybil Sounds the Alarm Image" title="Sybil Sounds the Alarm Image" height="344" width="300" class="inln_img"></div></div><div class="paragraph">     "That red glow in the sky,"Colonel Ludington said, turning now to his daughter, "is from Danbury. It's been burned by British raiders. There are about two thousand Redcoats, and they're heading for Ridgefield. Someone must tell our men that the lull in the fighting is over; they will have to leave their families and crops again."</div><div class="paragraph">     "I'll go! Star and I can do it!" Sybil exclaimed. She faced her mother. "Star is sure of foot, and will carry me safely."</div><div class="paragraph">     "There are dangers other than slippery paths," her mother said, softly. "Outlaws or deserters or Tories or even British soldiers may be met. You must be wary in a way that Star cannot."</div><div class="paragraph">     A lump rose in Sybil's throat. "I can do it," she declared.</div><div class="paragraph">     Without another word, Abigail Ludington turned to fetch a woolen cape to protect her daughter from the wind and rain. One of the boys was sent to saddle Star, and Sybil was soon ready. When she had swung up on her sturdy horse, the colonel placed a stick in her hand.</div><div class="paragraph">     As though reciting an oath, she repeated her father's directions: "Go south by the river, then along Horse Pound Road to Mahopac Pond. From there, turn right to Red Mills, then go north to Stormville." The colonel stood back and saluted. She was off!</div><div class="paragraph">     At the first few isolated houses, windows or doors flew open as she approached. She shouted her message and rode on. By the time she reached the first hamlet, all was dark. There were many small houses there at the edge of Shaw's Road, but everyone was in bed. Lights had not flared up at the sound of Star's hoofbeats. Sybil had not anticipated this. Biting her lower lip, she pulled Star to a halt. After considering for a moment, she nudged the horse forward, and riding up to one cottage after another, beat on each door with her stick.</div><div class="paragraph">     "Look at the sky!" she shouted. "Danbury's burning! All men muster at Ludingtons'!"</div><div class="paragraph">     At each village or cluster of houses, she repeated the cry. When lights began to shine and people were yelling and moving about, she would spur her horse onward. Before she and Star melted into the night, the village bells would be pealing out the alarm.</div><div class="paragraph">     Paths were slippery with mud and wet stones, and the terrain was often hilly and wooded. Sybil's ears strained for sounds of other riders who might try to steal her horse or stop her mission. Twice she pulled Star off the path while unknown riders passed within a few feet. Both times, her fright dried her mouth and made her hands tremble.</div><div class="paragraph">     By the time they reached Stormville, Star had stumbled several times, and Sybil's voice was almost gone. The town's call to arms was sounding as they turned homeward. Covered with mud, tired beyond belief, Sybil could barely stay on Star's back when they rode into their yard. She had ridden more than thirty miles that night.</div><div class="paragraph">     In a daze, she saw the red sky in the east. It was the dawn. Several hundred men were milling about. She had roused them in time, and Ludington's regiment marched out to join the Connecticut militia in routing the British at Ridgefield, driving them back to their ships on Long Island Sound.</div><div class="paragraph">     Afterward, General George Washington made a personal visit to Ludingtons' Mills to thank Sybil for her courageous deed. Statesman Alexander Hamilton wrote her a letter of praise.</div><div class="paragraph">     Two centuries later visitors to the area of Patterson, New York, can still follow Sybil's route. A statue of Sybil on horseback stands at Lake Gleneida in Carmel, New York, and people in that area know well the heroism of Sybil Ludington. In 1978, a commemorative postage stamp was issued in her honor, bringing national attention to the heroic young girl who rode for independence.</div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:75%">From <span class="stressed_text_2">Cobblestone's</span> September, 1983, issue: "Patriotic Tales of the American Revolution."

Anne was thirteen years old when she began keeping her diary on June 12, 1942. Two years later, in August 1944, the Nazis raided the Annex. Anne died seven or eight months later in a concentration camp. She was fifteen years old.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Anne's diary was first published in 1947. Since then it has been translated and published throughout the world. Through the publication of her diary, Anne has come to symbolize to the world the six million Jews killed by the Nazis.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Although Anne's diary is read throughout the world, her fiction is not as well known. In 1943–1944, Anne wrote a number of stories and began a novel, now published in <span class="stressed_text_2">Tales from the Secret Annex.</span> Anne states in her diary that she wanted to be a famous writer. Her fiction, like her diary, shows that she was indeed talented. The following excerpt is from her unfinished novel, <span class="stressed_text_2">Cady's Life.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center; font-size:140%;"><span class="stressed_text_1">CADY'S LIFE</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center">by Anne Frank</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      It was a hard time for the Jews. The fate of many would be decided in 1942. In July they began to round up boys and girls and deport them. Luckily Cady's girl friend Mary seemed to have been forgotten. Later it wasn't just the young people, no one was spared. In the fall and winter Cady went through terrible experiences. Night after night she heard cars driving down the street, she heard children screaming and doors being slammed. Mr. and Mrs. Van Altenhoven looked at each other and Cady in the lamplight, and in their eyes the question could be read: "Whom will they take tomorrow?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      One evening in December, Cady decided to run over to Mary's house and cheer her up a little. That night the noise in the street was worse than ever. Cady rang three times at the Hopkens's and when Mary came to the front of the house and looked cautiously out of the window, she called out her name to reassure her. Cady was let in. The whole family sat waiting in gym suits, with packs on their backs. They all looked pale and didn't say a word when Cady stepped into the room. Would they sit there like this every night for months? The sight of all these pale, frightened faces was terrible. Every time a door slammed outside, a shock went through the people sitting there. Those slamming doors seemed to symbolize the slamming of the door of life.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      At ten o'clock Cady took her leave. She saw there was no point in her sitting there, there was nothing she could do to help or comfort these people, who already seemed to be in another world. The only one who kept her courage up a little was Mary. She nodded to Cady from time to time and tried desperately to get her parents and sisters to eat something.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Mary took her to the door and bolted it after her. Cady started home with her little flashlight. She hadn't taken five steps when she stopped still and listened; she heard steps around the corner, a whole regiment of soldiers. She couldn't see much in the darkness, but she knew very well who was coming and what it meant. She flattened herself against a wall, switched off her light, and hoped the men wouldn't see her. Then suddenly one of them stopped in front of her, brandishing a pistol and looking at her with threatening eyes and a cruel face. "Come!"That was all he said, and immediately she was roughly seized and led away.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "I'm a Christian girl of respectable parents," she managed to say. She trembled from top to toe and wondered what this brute would do to her. At all costs she must try to show him her identity card.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "What do you mean respectable? Let's see your card."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady took it out of her pocket.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "Why didn't you say so right away?" the man said as he looked at it. <span class="stressed_text_2">"So ein Lumpenpack!"*</span> Before she knew it she was lying on the street. Furious over his own mistake, the German had given the "respectable Christian girl" a violent shove. Without a thought for her pain or anything else, Cady stood up and ran home.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      After that night a week passed before Cady had a chance to visit Mary. But one afternoon she took time off, regardless of her work or other appointments. Before she got to the Hopkens's house she was as good as sure she wouldn't find Mary there, and, indeed, when she came to the door, it was sealed up.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady was seized with despair. "Who knows," she thought, "where Mary is now?" She turned around and went straight back home. She went to her room and slammed the door. With her coat still on, she threw herself down on the sofa, and thought and thought about Mary.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Why did Mary have to go away when she, Cady, could stay here? Why did Mary have to suffer her terrible fate when <span class="stressed_text_2">she</span> was left to enjoy herself? What difference was there between them? Was she better than Mary in any way? Weren't they exactly the same? What crime had Mary committed? Oh, this could only be a terrible injustice. And suddenly she saw Mary's little figure before her, shut up in a cell, dressed in rags, with a sunken, emaciated face. Her eyes were very big, and she looked at Cady so sadly and reproachfully. Cady couldn't stand it anymore, she fell on her knees and cried and cried, cried till her whole body shook. Over and over again she saw Mary's eyes begging for help, help that Cady knew she couldn't give her.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "Mary, forgive me, come back..."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady no longer knew what to say or to think. For this misery that she saw so clearly before her eyes there were no words. Doors slammed in her ears, she heard children crying and in front of her she saw a troop of armed brutes, just like the one who had pushed her into the mud, and in among them, helpless and alone, Mary, Mary who was the same as she was.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">* "Such a bunch of scoundrels."</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:85%;">Excerpted from <span class="stressed_text_2">Cady's Life</span> by Anne Frank.

Anne was thirteen years old when she began keeping her diary on June 12, 1942. Two years later, in August 1944, the Nazis raided the Annex. Anne died seven or eight months later in a concentration camp. She was fifteen years old.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Anne's diary was first published in 1947. Since then it has been translated and published throughout the world. Through the publication of her diary, Anne has come to symbolize to the world the six million Jews killed by the Nazis.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Although Anne's diary is read throughout the world, her fiction is not as well known. In 1943–1944, Anne wrote a number of stories and began a novel, now published in <span class="stressed_text_2">Tales from the Secret Annex.</span> Anne states in her diary that she wanted to be a famous writer. Her fiction, like her diary, shows that she was indeed talented. The following excerpt is from her unfinished novel, <span class="stressed_text_2">Cady's Life.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center; font-size:140%;"><span class="stressed_text_1">CADY'S LIFE</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center">by Anne Frank</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      It was a hard time for the Jews. The fate of many would be decided in 1942. In July they began to round up boys and girls and deport them. Luckily Cady's girl friend Mary seemed to have been forgotten. Later it wasn't just the young people, no one was spared. In the fall and winter Cady went through terrible experiences. Night after night she heard cars driving down the street, she heard children screaming and doors being slammed. Mr. and Mrs. Van Altenhoven looked at each other and Cady in the lamplight, and in their eyes the question could be read: "Whom will they take tomorrow?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      One evening in December, Cady decided to run over to Mary's house and cheer her up a little. That night the noise in the street was worse than ever. Cady rang three times at the Hopkens's and when Mary came to the front of the house and looked cautiously out of the window, she called out her name to reassure her. Cady was let in. The whole family sat waiting in gym suits, with packs on their backs. They all looked pale and didn't say a word when Cady stepped into the room. Would they sit there like this every night for months? The sight of all these pale, frightened faces was terrible. Every time a door slammed outside, a shock went through the people sitting there. Those slamming doors seemed to symbolize the slamming of the door of life.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      At ten o'clock Cady took her leave. She saw there was no point in her sitting there, there was nothing she could do to help or comfort these people, who already seemed to be in another world. The only one who kept her courage up a little was Mary. She nodded to Cady from time to time and tried desperately to get her parents and sisters to eat something.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Mary took her to the door and bolted it after her. Cady started home with her little flashlight. She hadn't taken five steps when she stopped still and listened; she heard steps around the corner, a whole regiment of soldiers. She couldn't see much in the darkness, but she knew very well who was coming and what it meant. She flattened herself against a wall, switched off her light, and hoped the men wouldn't see her. Then suddenly one of them stopped in front of her, brandishing a pistol and looking at her with threatening eyes and a cruel face. "Come!"That was all he said, and immediately she was roughly seized and led away.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "I'm a Christian girl of respectable parents," she managed to say. She trembled from top to toe and wondered what this brute would do to her. At all costs she must try to show him her identity card.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "What do you mean respectable? Let's see your card."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady took it out of her pocket.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "Why didn't you say so right away?" the man said as he looked at it. <span class="stressed_text_2">"So ein Lumpenpack!"*</span> Before she knew it she was lying on the street. Furious over his own mistake, the German had given the "respectable Christian girl" a violent shove. Without a thought for her pain or anything else, Cady stood up and ran home.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      After that night a week passed before Cady had a chance to visit Mary. But one afternoon she took time off, regardless of her work or other appointments. Before she got to the Hopkens's house she was as good as sure she wouldn't find Mary there, and, indeed, when she came to the door, it was sealed up.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady was seized with despair. "Who knows," she thought, "where Mary is now?" She turned around and went straight back home. She went to her room and slammed the door. With her coat still on, she threw herself down on the sofa, and thought and thought about Mary.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Why did Mary have to go away when she, Cady, could stay here? Why did Mary have to suffer her terrible fate when <span class="stressed_text_2">she</span> was left to enjoy herself? What difference was there between them? Was she better than Mary in any way? Weren't they exactly the same? What crime had Mary committed? Oh, this could only be a terrible injustice. And suddenly she saw Mary's little figure before her, shut up in a cell, dressed in rags, with a sunken, emaciated face. Her eyes were very big, and she looked at Cady so sadly and reproachfully. Cady couldn't stand it anymore, she fell on her knees and cried and cried, cried till her whole body shook. Over and over again she saw Mary's eyes begging for help, help that Cady knew she couldn't give her.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "Mary, forgive me, come back..."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady no longer knew what to say or to think.

Anne was thirteen years old when she began keeping her diary on June 12, 1942. Two years later, in August 1944, the Nazis raided the Annex. Anne died seven or eight months later in a concentration camp. She was fifteen years old.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Anne's diary was first published in 1947. Since then it has been translated and published throughout the world. Through the publication of her diary, Anne has come to symbolize to the world the six million Jews killed by the Nazis.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Although Anne's diary is read throughout the world, her fiction is not as well known. In 1943–1944, Anne wrote a number of stories and began a novel, now published in <span class="stressed_text_2">Tales from the Secret Annex.</span> Anne states in her diary that she wanted to be a famous writer. Her fiction, like her diary, shows that she was indeed talented. The following excerpt is from her unfinished novel, <span class="stressed_text_2">Cady's Life.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center; font-size:140%;"><span class="stressed_text_1">CADY'S LIFE</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center">by Anne Frank</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      It was a hard time for the Jews. The fate of many would be decided in 1942. In July they began to round up boys and girls and deport them. Luckily Cady's girl friend Mary seemed to have been forgotten. Later it wasn't just the young people, no one was spared. In the fall and winter Cady went through terrible experiences. Night after night she heard cars driving down the street, she heard children screaming and doors being slammed. Mr. and Mrs. Van Altenhoven looked at each other and Cady in the lamplight, and in their eyes the question could be read: "Whom will they take tomorrow?"</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      One evening in December, Cady decided to run over to Mary's house and cheer her up a little. That night the noise in the street was worse than ever. Cady rang three times at the Hopkens's and when Mary came to the front of the house and looked cautiously out of the window, she called out her name to reassure her. Cady was let in. The whole family sat waiting in gym suits, with packs on their backs. They all looked pale and didn't say a word when Cady stepped into the room. Would they sit there like this every night for months? The sight of all these pale, frightened faces was terrible. Every time a door slammed outside, a shock went through the people sitting there. Those slamming doors seemed to symbolize the slamming of the door of life.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      At ten o'clock Cady took her leave. She saw there was no point in her sitting there, there was nothing she could do to help or comfort these people, who already seemed to be in another world. The only one who kept her courage up a little was Mary. She nodded to Cady from time to time and tried desperately to get her parents and sisters to eat something.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Mary took her to the door and bolted it after her. Cady started home with her little flashlight. She hadn't taken five steps when she stopped still and listened; she heard steps around the corner, a whole regiment of soldiers. She couldn't see much in the darkness, but she knew very well who was coming and what it meant. She flattened herself against a wall, switched off her light, and hoped the men wouldn't see her. Then suddenly one of them stopped in front of her, brandishing a pistol and looking at her with threatening eyes and a cruel face. "Come!"That was all he said, and immediately she was roughly seized and led away.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "I'm a Christian girl of respectable parents," she managed to say. She trembled from top to toe and wondered what this brute would do to her. At all costs she must try to show him her identity card.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "What do you mean respectable? Let's see your card."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady took it out of her pocket.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "Why didn't you say so right away?" the man said as he looked at it. <span class="stressed_text_2">"So ein Lumpenpack!"*</span> Before she knew it she was lying on the street. Furious over his own mistake, the German had given the "respectable Christian girl" a violent shove. Without a thought for her pain or anything else, Cady stood up and ran home.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      After that night a week passed before Cady had a chance to visit Mary. But one afternoon she took time off, regardless of her work or other appointments. Before she got to the Hopkens's house she was as good as sure she wouldn't find Mary there, and, indeed, when she came to the door, it was sealed up.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady was seized with despair. "Who knows," she thought, "where Mary is now?" She turned around and went straight back home. She went to her room and slammed the door. With her coat still on, she threw herself down on the sofa, and thought and thought about Mary.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Why did Mary have to go away when she, Cady, could stay here? Why did Mary have to suffer her terrible fate when <span class="stressed_text_2">she</span> was left to enjoy herself? What difference was there between them? Was she better than Mary in any way? Weren't they exactly the same? What crime had Mary committed? Oh, this could only be a terrible injustice. And suddenly she saw Mary's little figure before her, shut up in a cell, dressed in rags, with a sunken, emaciated face. Her eyes were very big, and she looked at Cady so sadly and reproachfully. Cady couldn't stand it anymore, she fell on her knees and cried and cried, cried till her whole body shook. Over and over again she saw Mary's eyes begging for help, help that Cady knew she couldn't give her.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "Mary, forgive me, come back..."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady no longer knew what to say or to think. For this misery that she saw so clearly before her eyes there were no words. Doors slammed in her ears, she heard children crying and in front of her she saw a troop of armed brutes, just like the one who had pushed her into the mud, and in among them, helpless and alone, Mary, Mary who was the same as she was.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">* "Such a bunch of scoundrels."</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:85%;">Excerpted from <span class="stressed_text_2">Cady's Life</span> by Anne Frank.

The whole family sat waiting in gym suits, with packs on their backs. They all looked pale and didn't say a word when Cady stepped into the room. Would they sit there like this every night for months? The sight of all these pale, frightened faces was terrible. Every time a door slammed outside, a shock went through the people sitting there. Those slamming doors seemed to symbolize the slamming of the door of life.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      At ten o'clock Cady took her leave. She saw there was no point in her sitting there, there was nothing she could do to help or comfort these people, who already seemed to be in another world. The only one who kept her courage up a little was Mary. She nodded to Cady from time to time and tried desperately to get her parents and sisters to eat something.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Mary took her to the door and bolted it after her. Cady started home with her little flashlight. She hadn't taken five steps when she stopped still and listened; she heard steps around the corner, a whole regiment of soldiers. She couldn't see much in the darkness, but she knew very well who was coming and what it meant. She flattened herself against a wall, switched off her light, and hoped the men wouldn't see her. Then suddenly one of them stopped in front of her, brandishing a pistol and looking at her with threatening eyes and a cruel face. "Come!"That was all he said, and immediately she was roughly seized and led away.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "I'm a Christian girl of respectable parents," she managed to say. She trembled from top to toe and wondered what this brute would do to her. At all costs she must try to show him her identity card.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "What do you mean respectable? Let's see your card."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady took it out of her pocket.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "Why didn't you say so right away?" the man said as he looked at it. <span class="stressed_text_2">"So ein Lumpenpack!"*</span> Before she knew it she was lying on the street. Furious over his own mistake, the German had given the "respectable Christian girl" a violent shove. Without a thought for her pain or anything else, Cady stood up and ran home.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      After that night a week passed before Cady had a chance to visit Mary. But one afternoon she took time off, regardless of her work or other appointments. Before she got to the Hopkens's house she was as good as sure she wouldn't find Mary there, and, indeed, when she came to the door, it was sealed up.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady was seized with despair. "Who knows," she thought, "where Mary is now?" She turned around and went straight back home. She went to her room and slammed the door. With her coat still on, she threw herself down on the sofa, and thought and thought about Mary.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Why did Mary have to go away when she, Cady, could stay here? Why did Mary have to suffer her terrible fate when <span class="stressed_text_2">she</span> was left to enjoy herself? What difference was there between them? Was she better than Mary in any way? Weren't they exactly the same? What crime had Mary committed? Oh, this could only be a terrible injustice. And suddenly she saw Mary's little figure before her, shut up in a cell, dressed in rags, with a sunken, emaciated face. Her eyes were very big, and she looked at Cady so sadly and reproachfully. Cady couldn't stand it anymore, she fell on her knees and cried and cried, cried till her whole body shook. Over and over again she saw Mary's eyes begging for help, help that Cady knew she couldn't give her.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "Mary, forgive me, come back..."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Cady no longer knew what to say or to think. For this misery that she saw so clearly before her eyes there were no words. Doors slammed in her ears, she heard children crying and in front of her she saw a troop of armed brutes, just like the one who had pushed her into the mud, and in among them, helpless and alone, Mary, Mary who was the same as she was.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">* "Such a bunch of scoundrels."</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:85%;">Excerpted from <span class="stressed_text_2">Cady's Life</span> by Anne Frank.

Yet almost single-handedly, she transformed the way people with mental illness were treated.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Dorothea was born in Maine in 1802 to a neglectful father and a mother who had trouble coping with daily activities. She ran away at the age of twelve to live with her grandmother, a cold, inflexible woman who nevertheless taught her the importance of doing her duty, as well as the organizational skills to help her do it.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Dorothea grew into an attractive woman, with blue-gray eyes, wavy brown hair, and a rich, low speaking voice. As a young adult, she spent her time teaching, writing books for children, and fighting the effect of tuberculosis. Despite her poor health, by age thirty-nine, she had saved enough money so that she had no financial worries. Afraid that her health was too poor for her to continue teaching, she looked forward to a lonely, unfulfilling life.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Then a friend suggested that she teach a Sunday school class for women in a Massachusetts jail. It would be useful without overtaxing her. On her first day, she discovered that among the inmates were several mentally ill women. They were anxious to hear what she had to say, but she found it impossible to teach them because the room was unheated. Dix, angry at this neglect on the part of the authorities, asked noted humanitarian Samuel Howe for his help in taking the case to court. The court ordered the authorities to install a wood stove.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">This sparked Dix's interest in the ways mentally ill people were treated. Encouraged by Howe and education reformer Horace Mann, she spent two years visiting every asylum, almshouse, and jail in Massachusetts, quietly taking notes on the conditions. Her grandmother had trained her to be thorough, and the training paid off.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Dix put her findings into a memorial (a report) that Howe presented to the Massachusetts legislature: "I tell what I have seen... [I]nsane persons confined...in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens; chained, naked, beaten with rods and lashed into obedience."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The memorial caused an uproar: What kind of woman would be interested in such a subject and insist on discussing it in public? Gradually, the personal attacks abated, primarily because Dix's research had been so thorough and her results were so complete that no one could argue with them. Howe was able to push a bill through the Massachusetts legislature to enlarge the state asylum.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Dix spent the next few years systematically studying conditions and getting legislation passed in other states. Her health did not keep her from putting in long hours of hard work and travel. First, she studied the psychological and legal views of mental illness and its treatment. Before she went into a state, she examined local laws and previous proposals for change. Then she visited every institution, small or large, and met with administrators, politicians, and private citizens. She put all this information together in a memorial that was presented to the legislature. She also wrote newspaper articles to inform the public of her findings. By this time, she knew what kind of opposition to expect, and she could help deflect it by appealing to the citizens' sense of pride or desire for economy. She also met privately with small groups of politicians to answer their questions and try to persuade them to come around to her point of view. She was usually successful, and public institutions to house and treat people with mental illness were established.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Unfortunately, that success did not carry over to her next goal: national legislation to improve the living conditions for people with mental illness. In the 1850s, Congress passed a bill setting aside land for the establishment of national hospitals for those with mental illness, but President Franklin Pierce vetoed the bill on constitutional grounds.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Dix was shattered. Her health, which had been surprisingly good during her struggles, took a turn for the worse, and doctors recommended she take a long voyage. Dix was unable to relax, however, and her vacation turned into a marathon journey through Europe, as she examined the living conditions of mentally ill people in each place she visited. She spoke with doctors, government officials, and even the pope, pleading for humanitarian treatment for those who were mentally ill. She went as far east as Constantinople (now Istanbul) in Turkey and as far north as St. Petersburg (now Leningrad) in Russia. She was greeted respectfully everywhere she went, and many of her recommendations were followed.</div><div class="paragraph" align="center"><div class="stdaln_img"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(53)" alt="Dorothea Dix: Quiet Crusader Image" title="Dorothea Dix: Quiet Crusader Image" height="270" width="206" class="inln_img"></div></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">She returned to the United States in 1857 and was appointed superintendent of women nurses during the Civil War.

She died in 1887 at the age of eighty-five. Between 1841, when she began her crusade, and the year she died, thirty-two new hospitals for those who were mentally ill were built, most of them directly because she had brought the problem to the attention of people in power. Several other institutions in Canada and Europe, and even two in Japan, were established because of her influence.

Yet almost single-handedly, she transformed the way people with mental illness were treated.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Dorothea was born in Maine in 1802 to a neglectful father and a mother who had trouble coping with daily activities. She ran away at the age of twelve to live with her grandmother, a cold, inflexible woman who nevertheless taught her the importance of doing her duty, as well as the organizational skills to help her do it.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Dorothea grew into an attractive woman, with blue-gray eyes, wavy brown hair, and a rich, low speaking voice. As a young adult, she spent her time teaching, writing books for children, and fighting the effect of tuberculosis. Despite her poor health, by age thirty-nine, she had saved enough money so that she had no financial worries. Afraid that her health was too poor for her to continue teaching, she looked forward to a lonely, unfulfilling life.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Then a friend suggested that she teach a Sunday school class for women in a Massachusetts jail. It would be useful without overtaxing her. On her first day, she discovered that among the inmates were several mentally ill women. They were anxious to hear what she had to say, but she found it impossible to teach them because the room was unheated. Dix, angry at this neglect on the part of the authorities, asked noted humanitarian Samuel Howe for his help in taking the case to court. The court ordered the authorities to install a wood stove.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">This sparked Dix's interest in the ways mentally ill people were treated. Encouraged by Howe and education reformer Horace Mann, she spent two years visiting every asylum, almshouse, and jail in Massachusetts, quietly taking notes on the conditions. Her grandmother had trained her to be thorough, and the training paid off.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Dix put her findings into a memorial (a report) that Howe presented to the Massachusetts legislature: "I tell what I have seen... [I]nsane persons confined...in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens; chained, naked, beaten with rods and lashed into obedience."</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">The memorial caused an uproar: What kind of woman would be interested in such a subject and insist on discussing it in public? Gradually, the personal attacks abated, primarily because Dix's research had been so thorough and her results were so complete that no one could argue with them. Howe was able to push a bill through the Massachusetts legislature to enlarge the state asylum.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Dix spent the next few years systematically studying conditions and getting legislation passed in other states. Her health did not keep her from putting in long hours of hard work and travel. First, she studied the psychological and legal views of mental illness and its treatment. Before she went into a state, she examined local laws and previous proposals for change. Then she visited every institution, small or large, and met with administrators, politicians, and private citizens. She put all this information together in a memorial that was presented to the legislature. She also wrote newspaper articles to inform the public of her findings. By this time, she knew what kind of opposition to expect, and she could help deflect it by appealing to the citizens' sense of pride or desire for economy. She also met privately with small groups of politicians to answer their questions and try to persuade them to come around to her point of view. She was usually successful, and public institutions to house and treat people with mental illness were established.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Unfortunately, that success did not carry over to her next goal: national legislation to improve the living conditions for people with mental illness. In the 1850s, Congress passed a bill setting aside land for the establishment of national hospitals for those with mental illness, but President Franklin Pierce vetoed the bill on constitutional grounds.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">Dix was shattered. Her health, which had been surprisingly good during her struggles, took a turn for the worse, and doctors recommended she take a long voyage. Dix was unable to relax, however, and her vacation turned into a marathon journey through Europe, as she examined the living conditions of mentally ill people in each place she visited. She spoke with doctors, government officials, and even the pope, pleading for humanitarian treatment for those who were mentally ill. She went as far east as Constantinople (now Istanbul) in Turkey and as far north as St. Petersburg (now Leningrad) in Russia. She was greeted respectfully everywhere she went, and many of her recommendations were followed.</div><div class="paragraph" align="center"><div class="stdaln_img"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(53)" alt="Dorothea Dix: Quiet Crusader Image" title="Dorothea Dix: Quiet Crusader Image" height="270" width="206" class="inln_img"></div></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">She returned to the United States in 1857 and was appointed superintendent of women nurses during the Civil War.

She died in 1887 at the age of eighty-five. Between 1841, when she began her crusade, and the year she died, thirty-two new hospitals for those who were mentally ill were built, most of them directly because she had brought the problem to the attention of people in power.

They seem to have always been on the move, searching for a better place to live. From America's first colonies small groups of people uprooted themselves, migrating westward to look for better farmland. They built pioneer roads, or trails, such as the Cumberland Road that led into the Ohio Valley, and the Genesee Road that led across New York to the shores of Lake Erie. Many of these roads and trails have disappeared. Others can still be traced, revealing artifacts along the way that help us to recreate their story.</div><div class="paragraph">     The Oregon Trail is one of these trails. Even today you can retrace its path, walking beside wagon ruts that were gouged almost a century and a half ago. The Oregon Trail was different from the earlier trails and roads that had crossed the Appalachian Mountains in the East. It was longer and more difficult than most pioneers had experienced. Unlike the eastern trails, the Oregon Trail crossed nearly 2,000 miles of unfamiliar prairie, desert, and mountainous regions. There were no settlements along the way that could offer friendly hospitality, and emigrants couldn't scout out their new homeland before they moved there. Oregon Country was so far away, it took from four to six months to get there. When people moved there, they moved to stay.</div><div class="paragraph">     The story of the Oregon Trail and the people who used it begins when the trail was an ancient Indian footpath used by explorers and fur traders. Independence, Missouri, was the frontier town that served as the starting place. The trail wound westward, following the banks of the Platte, North Platte, and Snake Rivers. It crossed the Rockies through the South Pass, crossed the Blue Mountains further north, and ended in Oregon Country at a place called The Dalles. From The Dalles, anyone continuing on to the Williamette Valley floated down the Columbia River. Up until the mid-1830s, no wagon had ever made the trip.</div><div class="paragraph">     It is difficult for us to imagine Oregon Country as it was a century and a half ago. A vast wilderness that stretched from the crest of the Rockies to the Pacific coast, it included the present states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The area was inhabited by several tribes of Indians, including the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Nez Perce. There were some trappers and traders in the region, but to most, the area was too far away and too strange for them to consider settling there.</div><div class="paragraph">     President Thomas Jefferson was the first to actively encourage exploration of Oregon Country. After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, he sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark into the area to seek a trade route to the Pacific. Jefferson knew that their explorations would help the United States strengthen its claim to the Pacific Northwest.</div><div class="paragraph">     It is important to remember that for the first half of the nineteenth century both Great Britain and the United States occupied the Pacific Northwest. Great Britain already had a strong claim to the land that was to become Canada, and the Hudson's Bay Company had many fur trading posts in the Pacific Northwest. There were American fur trading posts as well, such as the American Fur Company organized by John Jacob Astor in 1808.</div><div class="paragraph">     In 1818, Great Britain and the United States signed a treaty that allowed both countries to occupy the area, but it was not until the 1830s that Americans began moving in. Missionaries, such as Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, were among the first settlers. When people learned that the Whitmans had journeyed successfully over the Oregon Trail in 1836, they began to think differently about Oregon Country. The fact that a woman had made the journey safely, and that the Whitmans had traveled with a wagon, encouraged others to think that they could make the journey, too.</div><div class="paragraph">     In fact, when Dr. Whitman returned East in 1842 to help promote his missionary work, he found many people who were eager to travel to Oregon Country. In 1843, some 1,000 people and 2,000 animals joined Dr. Whitman and a surveyor named Jesse Applegate as they led a wagon train over the Oregon Trail. The "great migration" — one of the greatest migrations in recorded history — had begun.</div><div class="paragraph">     Why were so many people going to Oregon Country? Some said they had Oregon fever, a "disease" that made them restless, hungry for new land, and eager for adventure. But why were they going all the way to Oregon Country? One very important reason was that the United States government was encouraging them to do so. Since Thomas Jefferson's presidency, our government had come a long way toward believing that the United States should stretch from coast to coast. If Americans were to settle the Oregon Country in large numbers, our claim to the land would be strengthened.</div><div class="paragraph">     One man in particular wrote reports about the Oregon Country that were designed to make people want to go there. His name was John Charles Frémont (1813-90). He was a soldier, explorer and political leader who, in 1838, was asked to be the chief assistant in mapping the upper waters of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. He wrote very detailed descriptions of his explorations, and his reports were reprinted and read by many people. It was Frémont who wrote guidebooks for emigrants who were encouraged to settle in Oregon Country and help wrest it from British control.</div><div class="paragraph">     As Americans began pouring into the Williamette River valley in the 1840s, a dispute between Great Britain and the United States almost caused a war. The biggest disagreement was over the northern boundary of the Oregon Country. The British wanted the boundary to be on the north bank of the Columbia River. The Americans wanted it further north on the 54th Parallel. After careful negotiations, war was prevented when the two countries signed the Oregon Treaty of 1846. They agreed to compromise, placing the boundary on the 49th Parallel extending to Puget sound and leaving Vancouver Island as a part of Canada.</div><div class="paragraph">     The Oregon Treaty gave the United States undisputed claim to the Pacific Northwest, encouraging even more emigrants to move west. By the 1850s, the Oregon Trail had become a series of parallel wagon ruts that could be seen even in solid rock. Oregon Country officially became the Oregon Territory in 1848. In 1859, the state of Oregon was created and admitted to the Union as the 33rd state. Twenty years earlier the area had been an unknown wilderness!</div><div class="paragraph">     What was it like to travel on the Oregon Trail in the 1840s and 1850s? Fortunately there are many accounts that have survived, written by the people who used the trail and who wanted to preserve their experiences for later generations. The story of the Sager children was preserved by three of the Sager girls who survived. Diaries, such as the one handed down to Jean Burroughs, provide eyewitness accounts of the daily travel. When we read these accounts, we can easily imagine the hardship, the anxiety, and the excitement the emigrants must have experienced.</div><div class="paragraph">     According to several historians, at least 30,000 emigrants died on the Oregon Trail between 1843 and 1859. You might say that there is an average of one grave for every 100 yards of trail from the Missouri River to the Williamette River! Why did so many people die? Cholera, a disease that spreads when there are filthy conditions caused by garbage and sewage, claimed thousands of lives. Emigrants passed through, and sometimes camped near, the refuse left by earlier wagon trains. Other diseases caused people to die, but cholera was probably the most common.</div><div class="paragraph">     Accident was another common cause of death. Children often hurt themselves as the wagons rolled along. Doctors were not always available, and even when they were they often lacked necessary supplies. Most of the emigrants were simply not prepared for the difficult journey ahead, and they were careless.</div><div class="paragraph">     There were some problems as the emigrants passed through Indian territory. Indian attacks usually took the form of raids on the livestock, but few people were ever killed. The Indians owned much of the land on both sides of the Oregon Trail, and the emigrants were trespassing. Some tribal leaders demanded payment as the wagon trains rolled through, and, if the emigrants cooperated, there was no further trouble. In other instances, the Indians made a surprise attack, took livestock, and left the wagons unharmed.</div><div class="paragraph">     It would be several years later, in the 1860s, when the Indians would finally realize that their homelands had been lost forever. Tribal chiefs, such as Red Cloud and Crazy Horse, both of the Oglala Sioux, devoted their lives to trying to save their homelands and people. But the idea that the United States should stretch from coast to coast had already taken hold. The Oregon Trail, no longer just a footpath, had opened the way to the West.</div><div class="paragraph">From Cobblestone's December, 1981, issue: <span class="stressed_text_2">The Oregon Trail.</span> © 1981, Cobblestone Publishing Inc., Peterborough, NH 03458.

Burroughs</div><div class="paragraph"><div class="stdaln_img"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(54)" alt="Nettie&#39;s Big Fish Image" title="Nettie&#39;s Big Fish Image" height="350" width="436" class="inln_img"></div></div><div class="paragraph">     "Here's your baited hook and line, Daughter. See what you can land. Every family in our wagon train needs fresh fish for supper." Nettie Emory's father stood by her on the banks of the North Platte River late one evening in June, 1863. "And mind you keep your shoes on this time, Pet."</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie drew down the corners of her mouth in disappointment. She'd been counting on cool water and squishy mud to cool her feet, hot and sweaty from her high–topped, laced shoes. She knew her father was referring to the time she had wandered from camp to gather "yellow roses,"the enticing blooms of prickly pear cactus. Stepping on dozens of stickers in her bare feet was a painful experience she would never forget. She'd never seen cactus before so how was she supposed to know?</div><div class="paragraph">     Now, holding her line and hook high, Nettie edged closer to the water, hoping against hope she would catch a fish. Otherwise, it was going to be salt bacon and corn pone for supper again. After several weeks on the Oregon Trail, their supply of meat was used up. Even wild game had been scarce, and they had not yet reached the plentiful buffalo on the plains. She was certainly tired of the monotonous diet.</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie's father called back over his shoulder. "Remember there's quicksand and sinkholes. Test the ground before you step. Stay close to me. Good luck, Blackie."</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie grinned at her father's use of her nickname, given because of her unusually dark hair and eyes. Her French mother preferred Minette, but had agreed to the shortened form of Nettie. An only child, the nine–year–old girl answered to all the names that her loving parents called her. She was proud that her father had been chosen wagon master to lead the train over the plains and mountains to faraway Oregon. Perhaps if she caught a fish, he'd be proud of her too, just as he was when she drove the ox team safely during her mother's illness. She wanted to help him during this difficult journey as much as she could.</div><div class="paragraph">     She watched him and the other men choose places to cast their lines at the water's edge. Some waded into the shallows near the sand islands in the river where the current was running swifter because of a recent rain. Through a thicket of willows she edged closer to where a quiet pool had formed under the tree roots. Just the place for a fish to hide, she thought. She quietly dropped her hook, watching it sink to the bottom. Then she waited, swinging her sun-bonnet strings back and forth to brush off the gnats and mosquitoes that hummed around her face.</div><div class="paragraph">     She waited. She waited, but no fish rose to her bait. As she slid down the riverbank she kept her father's black hat in sight. Her line drifted faster with the fresh current. Fishing can be tiresome, she fretted, but it's better than just watching the trail from the back of our crowded wagon.</div><div class="paragraph">     None of the men had caught a fish so far. She squinted at the sun, well above the horizon of the summer sky. There's plenty of time before supper fires are lighted, she thought. With her left hand she slapped at a pesky mosquito again; her right hand tightened its grip on the pole. A sudden jerk on the line caused her to stumble forward to keep her balance. A bite! A bite! The pull on her line was steady and strong. She lifted her pole and it bent forward. It surely must be a big one.</div><div class="paragraph">     And it was a big one, big enough to pull Nettie dangerously toward the water. Her breath came in gasps. She dug in the heels of her sturdy shoes, glad now that she wasn't barefoot. She couldn't back up because the end of the line was moving fast toward the center of the river. She could no longer see her father's hat because of the tall rushes growing at water's edge.</div><div class="paragraph">     Grimly, she held on. Her feet were already soaked. Would her next step be into quicksand? The line moved downstream, dragging Nettie into ankle–deep, then knee–deep water. She was excited about the catch and dared not let go. She also was becoming a little frightened.</div><div class="paragraph">     "Papa, Papa, I've got a big one!" she cried. "It's pulling me into the river!" Her voice was lost in the evening breeze that stirred the rushes. "Papa, can't you hear me?"</div><div class="paragraph">     How much longer could she hold on? She used all her strength. Her shoulders ached from the strain. "Help! Help!" she shouted to anyone who might hear her. She turned her body so that the line wrapped around her hips. Her legs sank deeper into the sandy bottom. Muddy water billowed out her full skirt. "I'm like an umbrella," she laughed to herself. "Now maybe they'll see me."</div><div class="paragraph">     Fresh fish or dry salt bacon: the very thought gave her extra endurance. Not just for her own family, but the other wagon people who were also hungry for a change in diet. Drawing a deeper breath, she called hoarsely, "Save me! Save my fish!"</div><div class="paragraph">     An answering shout gave her courage. She heard footsteps splashing nearer. "Blackie, hold on. Pull back," called her father. Other men dropped their poles and ran to help. Josiah Emory placed his body in front of his little girl's, grabbing the line with his strong hands. Nettie clung to the pole while her father slowly, steadily, pulled in the line. Soon a flashing, grey body flapped in and out of the water. "It's a big catfish, Blackie, a really huge one. Good girl! I'm proud of you." Only then did Nettie let go. He lifted the pole with a grunt at the unexpected weight. Indeed, it was a huge fish. Her father guessed it was over three feet long and more than twenty-five pounds.</div><div class="paragraph">     Sloshing back to the wagon, muddy and exhausted, Nettie wondered what her mother would say. Her dress and petticoats were caked with red mud. Her shoes squished water through the laces. Now perhaps I can go barefoot until my shoes dry, she thought. She hoped her mother would be so glad over the fish that she wouldn't scold.</div><div class="paragraph">     News of Nettie's big catch spread among the wagons. A hungry crowd gathered to watch while Nettie's father dressed the fish. "Build up the fire," he said. "We'll all feast tonight. No ration of salt pork but fresh fish for all."</div><div class="paragraph">     "And biscuits and syrup instead of corn bread?" Nettie asked her mother.</div><div class="paragraph">     "Yes, Minette. All the biscuits and syrup and fish you can eat."</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie grinned a happy, tired grin. "I'll always remember how that fish almost swam away with me. I am going to write about it in my diary."</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">A Note from the Author:</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">     This is a true story. A copy of Nettie Emory's diary was given to me by her granddaughter. From Nettie's entries about her trip on the Oregon Trail, written in 1863, I have retold her exciting adventure with the big fish. Of course I used imaginary conversation and descriptions. This is what Nettie wrote in her diary:</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">     "I was allowed to fish with the men in the Missouri River. Suddenly a fish took my bait, and I was pulled to the water's edge. My father heard my call for help. He began to run when he saw me splashing in the water. Other men helped him land the fish while I went back to the wagon to dry out. The fish was over three feet long and weighed about 25 pounds. I was the only one who caught a fish that day but we shared it with the others."</span></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph">From Cobblestone's December, 1981, issue: <span class="stressed_text_2">The Oregon Trail.</span> © 1981, Cobblestone Publishing Inc., Peterborough, NH 03458.

See what you can land. Every family in our wagon train needs fresh fish for supper." Nettie Emory's father stood by her on the banks of the North Platte River late one evening in June, 1863. "And mind you keep your shoes on this time, Pet."</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie drew down the corners of her mouth in disappointment. She'd been counting on cool water and squishy mud to cool her feet, hot and sweaty from her high–topped, laced shoes. She knew her father was referring to the time she had wandered from camp to gather "yellow roses,"the enticing blooms of prickly pear cactus. Stepping on dozens of stickers in her bare feet was a painful experience she would never forget. She'd never seen cactus before so how was she supposed to know?</div><div class="paragraph">     Now, holding her line and hook high, Nettie edged closer to the water, hoping against hope she would catch a fish. Otherwise, it was going to be salt bacon and corn pone for supper again. After several weeks on the Oregon Trail, their supply of meat was used up. Even wild game had been scarce, and they had not yet reached the plentiful buffalo on the plains. She was certainly tired of the monotonous diet.</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie's father called back over his shoulder. "Remember there's quicksand and sinkholes. Test the ground before you step. Stay close to me. Good luck, Blackie."</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie grinned at her father's use of her nickname, given because of her unusually dark hair and eyes. Her French mother preferred Minette, but had agreed to the shortened form of Nettie. An only child, the nine–year–old girl answered to all the names that her loving parents called her. She was proud that her father had been chosen wagon master to lead the train over the plains and mountains to faraway Oregon. Perhaps if she caught a fish, he'd be proud of her too, just as he was when she drove the ox team safely during her mother's illness. She wanted to help him during this difficult journey as much as she could.</div><div class="paragraph">     She watched him and the other men choose places to cast their lines at the water's edge. Some waded into the shallows near the sand islands in the river where the current was running swifter because of a recent rain. Through a thicket of willows she edged closer to where a quiet pool had formed under the tree roots. Just the place for a fish to hide, she thought. She quietly dropped her hook, watching it sink to the bottom. Then she waited, swinging her sun-bonnet strings back and forth to brush off the gnats and mosquitoes that hummed around her face.</div><div class="paragraph">     She waited. She waited, but no fish rose to her bait. As she slid down the riverbank she kept her father's black hat in sight. Her line drifted faster with the fresh current. Fishing can be tiresome, she fretted, but it's better than just watching the trail from the back of our crowded wagon.</div><div class="paragraph">     None of the men had caught a fish so far. She squinted at the sun, well above the horizon of the summer sky. There's plenty of time before supper fires are lighted, she thought. With her left hand she slapped at a pesky mosquito again; her right hand tightened its grip on the pole. A sudden jerk on the line caused her to stumble forward to keep her balance. A bite! A bite! The pull on her line was steady and strong. She lifted her pole and it bent forward. It surely must be a big one.</div><div class="paragraph">     And it was a big one, big enough to pull Nettie dangerously toward the water. Her breath came in gasps. She dug in the heels of her sturdy shoes, glad now that she wasn't barefoot. She couldn't back up because the end of the line was moving fast toward the center of the river. She could no longer see her father's hat because of the tall rushes growing at water's edge.</div><div class="paragraph">     Grimly, she held on. Her feet were already soaked. Would her next step be into quicksand? The line moved downstream, dragging Nettie into ankle–deep, then knee–deep water. She was excited about the catch and dared not let go. She also was becoming a little frightened.</div><div class="paragraph">     "Papa, Papa, I've got a big one!" she cried. "It's pulling me into the river!" Her voice was lost in the evening breeze that stirred the rushes. "Papa, can't you hear me?"</div><div class="paragraph">     How much longer could she hold on? She used all her strength. Her shoulders ached from the strain. "Help! Help!" she shouted to anyone who might hear her. She turned her body so that the line wrapped around her hips. Her legs sank deeper into the sandy bottom. Muddy water billowed out her full skirt. "I'm like an umbrella," she laughed to herself. "Now maybe they'll see me."</div><div class="paragraph">     Fresh fish or dry salt bacon: the very thought gave her extra endurance. Not just for her own family, but the other wagon people who were also hungry for a change in diet. Drawing a deeper breath, she called hoarsely, "Save me! Save my fish!"</div><div class="paragraph">     An answering shout gave her courage. She heard footsteps splashing nearer. "Blackie, hold on. Pull back," called her father. Other men dropped their poles and ran to help. Josiah Emory placed his body in front of his little girl's, grabbing the line with his strong hands. Nettie clung to the pole while her father slowly, steadily, pulled in the line. Soon a flashing, grey body flapped in and out of the water. "It's a big catfish, Blackie, a really huge one. Good girl! I'm proud of you." Only then did Nettie let go. He lifted the pole with a grunt at the unexpected weight. Indeed, it was a huge fish. Her father guessed it was over three feet long and more than twenty-five pounds.</div><div class="paragraph">     Sloshing back to the wagon, muddy and exhausted, Nettie wondered what her mother would say. Her dress and petticoats were caked with red mud. Her shoes squished water through the laces. Now perhaps I can go barefoot until my shoes dry, she thought. She hoped her mother would be so glad over the fish that she wouldn't scold.</div><div class="paragraph">     News of Nettie's big catch spread among the wagons. A hungry crowd gathered to watch while Nettie's father dressed the fish. "Build up the fire," he said. "We'll all feast tonight. No ration of salt pork but fresh fish for all."</div><div class="paragraph">     "And biscuits and syrup instead of corn bread?" Nettie asked her mother.</div><div class="paragraph">     "Yes, Minette. All the biscuits and syrup and fish you can eat."</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie grinned a happy, tired grin. "I'll always remember how that fish almost swam away with me.

They seem to have always been on the move, searching for a better place to live. From America's first colonies small groups of people uprooted themselves, migrating westward to look for better farmland. They built pioneer roads, or trails, such as the Cumberland Road that led into the Ohio Valley, and the Genesee Road that led across New York to the shores of Lake Erie. Many of these roads and trails have disappeared. Others can still be traced, revealing artifacts along the way that help us to recreate their story.</div><div class="paragraph">     The Oregon Trail is one of these trails. Even today you can retrace its path, walking beside wagon ruts that were gouged almost a century and a half ago. The Oregon Trail was different from the earlier trails and roads that had crossed the Appalachian Mountains in the East. It was longer and more difficult than most pioneers had experienced. Unlike the eastern trails, the Oregon Trail crossed nearly 2,000 miles of unfamiliar prairie, desert, and mountainous regions. There were no settlements along the way that could offer friendly hospitality, and emigrants couldn't scout out their new homeland before they moved there. Oregon Country was so far away, it took from four to six months to get there. When people moved there, they moved to stay.</div><div class="paragraph">     The story of the Oregon Trail and the people who used it begins when the trail was an ancient Indian footpath used by explorers and fur traders. Independence, Missouri, was the frontier town that served as the starting place. The trail wound westward, following the banks of the Platte, North Platte, and Snake Rivers. It crossed the Rockies through the South Pass, crossed the Blue Mountains further north, and ended in Oregon Country at a place called The Dalles. From The Dalles, anyone continuing on to the Williamette Valley floated down the Columbia River. Up until the mid-1830s, no wagon had ever made the trip.</div><div class="paragraph">     It is difficult for us to imagine Oregon Country as it was a century and a half ago. A vast wilderness that stretched from the crest of the Rockies to the Pacific coast, it included the present states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The area was inhabited by several tribes of Indians, including the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Nez Perce. There were some trappers and traders in the region, but to most, the area was too far away and too strange for them to consider settling there.</div><div class="paragraph">     President Thomas Jefferson was the first to actively encourage exploration of Oregon Country. After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, he sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark into the area to seek a trade route to the Pacific. Jefferson knew that their explorations would help the United States strengthen its claim to the Pacific Northwest.</div><div class="paragraph">     It is important to remember that for the first half of the nineteenth century both Great Britain and the United States occupied the Pacific Northwest. Great Britain already had a strong claim to the land that was to become Canada, and the Hudson's Bay Company had many fur trading posts in the Pacific Northwest. There were American fur trading posts as well, such as the American Fur Company organized by John Jacob Astor in 1808.</div><div class="paragraph">     In 1818, Great Britain and the United States signed a treaty that allowed both countries to occupy the area, but it was not until the 1830s that Americans began moving in. Missionaries, such as Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, were among the first settlers. When people learned that the Whitmans had journeyed successfully over the Oregon Trail in 1836, they began to think differently about Oregon Country. The fact that a woman had made the journey safely, and that the Whitmans had traveled with a wagon, encouraged others to think that they could make the journey, too.</div><div class="paragraph">     In fact, when Dr. Whitman returned East in 1842 to help promote his missionary work, he found many people who were eager to travel to Oregon Country. In 1843, some 1,000 people and 2,000 animals joined Dr. Whitman and a surveyor named Jesse Applegate as they led a wagon train over the Oregon Trail. The "great migration" — one of the greatest migrations in recorded history — had begun.</div><div class="paragraph">     Why were so many people going to Oregon Country? Some said they had Oregon fever, a "disease" that made them restless, hungry for new land, and eager for adventure. But why were they going all the way to Oregon Country? One very important reason was that the United States government was encouraging them to do so. Since Thomas Jefferson's presidency, our government had come a long way toward believing that the United States should stretch from coast to coast. If Americans were to settle the Oregon Country in large numbers, our claim to the land would be strengthened.</div><div class="paragraph">     One man in particular wrote reports about the Oregon Country that were designed to make people want to go there. His name was John Charles Frémont (1813-90). He was a soldier, explorer and political leader who, in 1838, was asked to be the chief assistant in mapping the upper waters of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. He wrote very detailed descriptions of his explorations, and his reports were reprinted and read by many people. It was Frémont who wrote guidebooks for emigrants who were encouraged to settle in Oregon Country and help wrest it from British control.</div><div class="paragraph">     As Americans began pouring into the Williamette River valley in the 1840s, a dispute between Great Britain and the United States almost caused a war. The biggest disagreement was over the northern boundary of the Oregon Country. The British wanted the boundary to be on the north bank of the Columbia River. The Americans wanted it further north on the 54th Parallel. After careful negotiations, war was prevented when the two countries signed the Oregon Treaty of 1846. They agreed to compromise, placing the boundary on the 49th Parallel extending to Puget sound and leaving Vancouver Island as a part of Canada.</div><div class="paragraph">     The Oregon Treaty gave the United States undisputed claim to the Pacific Northwest, encouraging even more emigrants to move west. By the 1850s, the Oregon Trail had become a series of parallel wagon ruts that could be seen even in solid rock. Oregon Country officially became the Oregon Territory in 1848. In 1859, the state of Oregon was created and admitted to the Union as the 33rd state. Twenty years earlier the area had been an unknown wilderness!</div><div class="paragraph">     What was it like to travel on the Oregon Trail in the 1840s and 1850s? Fortunately there are many accounts that have survived, written by the people who used the trail and who wanted to preserve their experiences for later generations. The story of the Sager children was preserved by three of the Sager girls who survived. Diaries, such as the one handed down to Jean Burroughs, provide eyewitness accounts of the daily travel. When we read these accounts, we can easily imagine the hardship, the anxiety, and the excitement the emigrants must have experienced.</div><div class="paragraph">     According to several historians, at least 30,000 emigrants died on the Oregon Trail between 1843 and 1859. You might say that there is an average of one grave for every 100 yards of trail from the Missouri River to the Williamette River! Why did so many people die? Cholera, a disease that spreads when there are filthy conditions caused by garbage and sewage, claimed thousands of lives. Emigrants passed through, and sometimes camped near, the refuse left by earlier wagon trains. Other diseases caused people to die, but cholera was probably the most common.</div><div class="paragraph">     Accident was another common cause of death. Children often hurt themselves as the wagons rolled along. Doctors were not always available, and even when they were they often lacked necessary supplies. Most of the emigrants were simply not prepared for the difficult journey ahead, and they were careless.</div><div class="paragraph">     There were some problems as the emigrants passed through Indian territory. Indian attacks usually took the form of raids on the livestock, but few people were ever killed. The Indians owned much of the land on both sides of the Oregon Trail, and the emigrants were trespassing. Some tribal leaders demanded payment as the wagon trains rolled through, and, if the emigrants cooperated, there was no further trouble. In other instances, the Indians made a surprise attack, took livestock, and left the wagons unharmed.</div><div class="paragraph">     It would be several years later, in the 1860s, when the Indians would finally realize that their homelands had been lost forever. Tribal chiefs, such as Red Cloud and Crazy Horse, both of the Oglala Sioux, devoted their lives to trying to save their homelands and people. But the idea that the United States should stretch from coast to coast had already taken hold. The Oregon Trail, no longer just a footpath, had opened the way to the West.</div><div class="paragraph">From Cobblestone's December, 1981, issue: <span class="stressed_text_2">The Oregon Trail.</span> © 1981, Cobblestone Publishing Inc., Peterborough, NH 03458.

<div class="questionwrapper"><div class="question"><div class="stimulus"><div class="stimlabel">Reading Passage</div><div class="paragraph"><div class="prose1"><table style="background-color:#f0f0f0" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="400" align="center"><tbody><tr><td><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center"><span class="font-size:140%"><span class="stressed_text_1">The Oregon Trail</span></span></div><div class="paragraph">     Americans have long been thought of as a restless group of people. They seem to have always been on the move, searching for a better place to live. From America's first colonies small groups of people uprooted themselves, migrating westward to look for better farmland. They built pioneer roads, or trails, such as the Cumberland Road that led into the Ohio Valley, and the Genesee Road that led across New York to the shores of Lake Erie. Many of these roads and trails have disappeared. Others can still be traced, revealing artifacts along the way that help us to recreate their story.</div><div class="paragraph">     The Oregon Trail is one of these trails. Even today you can retrace its path, walking beside wagon ruts that were gouged almost a century and a half ago. The Oregon Trail was different from the earlier trails and roads that had crossed the Appalachian Mountains in the East. It was longer and more difficult than most pioneers had experienced. Unlike the eastern trails, the Oregon Trail crossed nearly 2,000 miles of unfamiliar prairie, desert, and mountainous regions. There were no settlements along the way that could offer friendly hospitality, and emigrants couldn't scout out their new homeland before they moved there. Oregon Country was so far away, it took from four to six months to get there. When people moved there, they moved to stay.</div><div class="paragraph">     The story of the Oregon Trail and the people who used it begins when the trail was an ancient Indian footpath used by explorers and fur traders. Independence, Missouri, was the frontier town that served as the starting place. The trail wound westward, following the banks of the Platte, North Platte, and Snake Rivers. It crossed the Rockies through the South Pass, crossed the Blue Mountains further north, and ended in Oregon Country at a place called The Dalles. From The Dalles, anyone continuing on to the Williamette Valley floated down the Columbia River. Up until the mid-1830s, no wagon had ever made the trip.</div><div class="paragraph">     It is difficult for us to imagine Oregon Country as it was a century and a half ago. A vast wilderness that stretched from the crest of the Rockies to the Pacific coast, it included the present states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The area was inhabited by several tribes of Indians, including the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Nez Perce. There were some trappers and traders in the region, but to most, the area was too far away and too strange for them to consider settling there.</div><div class="paragraph">     President Thomas Jefferson was the first to actively encourage exploration of Oregon Country. After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, he sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark into the area to seek a trade route to the Pacific. Jefferson knew that their explorations would help the United States strengthen its claim to the Pacific Northwest.</div><div class="paragraph">     It is important to remember that for the first half of the nineteenth century both Great Britain and the United States occupied the Pacific Northwest. Great Britain already had a strong claim to the land that was to become Canada, and the Hudson's Bay Company had many fur trading posts in the Pacific Northwest. There were American fur trading posts as well, such as the American Fur Company organized by John Jacob Astor in 1808.</div><div class="paragraph">     In 1818, Great Britain and the United States signed a treaty that allowed both countries to occupy the area, but it was not until the 1830s that Americans began moving in. Missionaries, such as Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, were among the first settlers. When people learned that the Whitmans had journeyed successfully over the Oregon Trail in 1836, they began to think differently about Oregon Country. The fact that a woman had made the journey safely, and that the Whitmans had traveled with a wagon, encouraged others to think that they could make the journey, too.</div><div class="paragraph">     In fact, when Dr. Whitman returned East in 1842 to help promote his missionary work, he found many people who were eager to travel to Oregon Country. In 1843, some 1,000 people and 2,000 animals joined Dr. Whitman and a surveyor named Jesse Applegate as they led a wagon train over the Oregon Trail. The "great migration" — one of the greatest migrations in recorded history — had begun.</div><div class="paragraph">     Why were so many people going to Oregon Country? Some said they had Oregon fever, a "disease" that made them restless, hungry for new land, and eager for adventure. But why were they going all the way to Oregon Country? One very important reason was that the United States government was encouraging them to do so. Since Thomas Jefferson's presidency, our government had come a long way toward believing that the United States should stretch from coast to coast. If Americans were to settle the Oregon Country in large numbers, our claim to the land would be strengthened.</div><div class="paragraph">     One man in particular wrote reports about the Oregon Country that were designed to make people want to go there. His name was John Charles Frémont (1813-90). He was a soldier, explorer and political leader who, in 1838, was asked to be the chief assistant in mapping the upper waters of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. He wrote very detailed descriptions of his explorations, and his reports were reprinted and read by many people. It was Frémont who wrote guidebooks for emigrants who were encouraged to settle in Oregon Country and help wrest it from British control.</div><div class="paragraph">     As Americans began pouring into the Williamette River valley in the 1840s, a dispute between Great Britain and the United States almost caused a war. The biggest disagreement was over the northern boundary of the Oregon Country. The British wanted the boundary to be on the north bank of the Columbia River. The Americans wanted it further north on the 54th Parallel. After careful negotiations, war was prevented when the two countries signed the Oregon Treaty of 1846. They agreed to compromise, placing the boundary on the 49th Parallel extending to Puget sound and leaving Vancouver Island as a part of Canada.</div><div class="paragraph">     The Oregon Treaty gave the United States undisputed claim to the Pacific Northwest, encouraging even more emigrants to move west. By the 1850s, the Oregon Trail had become a series of parallel wagon ruts that could be seen even in solid rock. Oregon Country officially became the Oregon Territory in 1848. In 1859, the state of Oregon was created and admitted to the Union as the 33rd state. Twenty years earlier the area had been an unknown wilderness!</div><div class="paragraph">     What was it like to travel on the Oregon Trail in the 1840s and 1850s? Fortunately there are many accounts that have survived, written by the people who used the trail and who wanted to preserve their experiences for later generations. The story of the Sager children was preserved by three of the Sager girls who survived. Diaries, such as the one handed down to Jean Burroughs, provide eyewitness accounts of the daily travel. When we read these accounts, we can easily imagine the hardship, the anxiety, and the excitement the emigrants must have experienced.</div><div class="paragraph">     According to several historians, at least 30,000 emigrants died on the Oregon Trail between 1843 and 1859. You might say that there is an average of one grave for every 100 yards of trail from the Missouri River to the Williamette River! Why did so many people die? Cholera, a disease that spreads when there are filthy conditions caused by garbage and sewage, claimed thousands of lives. Emigrants passed through, and sometimes camped near, the refuse left by earlier wagon trains. Other diseases caused people to die, but cholera was probably the most common.</div><div class="paragraph">     Accident was another common cause of death. Children often hurt themselves as the wagons rolled along. Doctors were not always available, and even when they were they often lacked necessary supplies. Most of the emigrants were simply not prepared for the difficult journey ahead, and they were careless.</div><div class="paragraph">     There were some problems as the emigrants passed through Indian territory. Indian attacks usually took the form of raids on the livestock, but few people were ever killed. The Indians owned much of the land on both sides of the Oregon Trail, and the emigrants were trespassing. Some tribal leaders demanded payment as the wagon trains rolled through, and, if the emigrants cooperated, there was no further trouble. In other instances, the Indians made a surprise attack, took livestock, and left the wagons unharmed.</div><div class="paragraph">     It would be several years later, in the 1860s, when the Indians would finally realize that their homelands had been lost forever. Tribal chiefs, such as Red Cloud and Crazy Horse, both of the Oglala Sioux, devoted their lives to trying to save their homelands and people. But the idea that the United States should stretch from coast to coast had already taken hold. The Oregon Trail, no longer just a footpath, had opened the way to the West.</div><div class="paragraph">From Cobblestone's December, 1981, issue: <span class="stressed_text_2">The Oregon Trail.</span> © 1981, Cobblestone Publishing Inc., Peterborough, NH 03458.

Burroughs</div><div class="paragraph"><div class="stdaln_img"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(54)" alt="Nettie&#39;s Big Fish Image" title="Nettie&#39;s Big Fish Image" height="350" width="436" class="inln_img"></div></div><div class="paragraph">     "Here's your baited hook and line, Daughter. See what you can land. Every family in our wagon train needs fresh fish for supper." Nettie Emory's father stood by her on the banks of the North Platte River late one evening in June, 1863. "And mind you keep your shoes on this time, Pet."</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie drew down the corners of her mouth in disappointment. She'd been counting on cool water and squishy mud to cool her feet, hot and sweaty from her high–topped, laced shoes. She knew her father was referring to the time she had wandered from camp to gather "yellow roses,"the enticing blooms of prickly pear cactus. Stepping on dozens of stickers in her bare feet was a painful experience she would never forget. She'd never seen cactus before so how was she supposed to know?</div><div class="paragraph">     Now, holding her line and hook high, Nettie edged closer to the water, hoping against hope she would catch a fish. Otherwise, it was going to be salt bacon and corn pone for supper again. After several weeks on the Oregon Trail, their supply of meat was used up. Even wild game had been scarce, and they had not yet reached the plentiful buffalo on the plains. She was certainly tired of the monotonous diet.</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie's father called back over his shoulder. "Remember there's quicksand and sinkholes. Test the ground before you step. Stay close to me. Good luck, Blackie."</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie grinned at her father's use of her nickname, given because of her unusually dark hair and eyes. Her French mother preferred Minette, but had agreed to the shortened form of Nettie. An only child, the nine–year–old girl answered to all the names that her loving parents called her. She was proud that her father had been chosen wagon master to lead the train over the plains and mountains to faraway Oregon. Perhaps if she caught a fish, he'd be proud of her too, just as he was when she drove the ox team safely during her mother's illness. She wanted to help him during this difficult journey as much as she could.</div><div class="paragraph">     She watched him and the other men choose places to cast their lines at the water's edge. Some waded into the shallows near the sand islands in the river where the current was running swifter because of a recent rain. Through a thicket of willows she edged closer to where a quiet pool had formed under the tree roots. Just the place for a fish to hide, she thought. She quietly dropped her hook, watching it sink to the bottom. Then she waited, swinging her sun-bonnet strings back and forth to brush off the gnats and mosquitoes that hummed around her face.</div><div class="paragraph">     She waited. She waited, but no fish rose to her bait. As she slid down the riverbank she kept her father's black hat in sight. Her line drifted faster with the fresh current. Fishing can be tiresome, she fretted, but it's better than just watching the trail from the back of our crowded wagon.</div><div class="paragraph">     None of the men had caught a fish so far. She squinted at the sun, well above the horizon of the summer sky. There's plenty of time before supper fires are lighted, she thought. With her left hand she slapped at a pesky mosquito again; her right hand tightened its grip on the pole. A sudden jerk on the line caused her to stumble forward to keep her balance. A bite! A bite! The pull on her line was steady and strong. She lifted her pole and it bent forward. It surely must be a big one.</div><div class="paragraph">     And it was a big one, big enough to pull Nettie dangerously toward the water. Her breath came in gasps. She dug in the heels of her sturdy shoes, glad now that she wasn't barefoot. She couldn't back up because the end of the line was moving fast toward the center of the river. She could no longer see her father's hat because of the tall rushes growing at water's edge.</div><div class="paragraph">     Grimly, she held on. Her feet were already soaked. Would her next step be into quicksand? The line moved downstream, dragging Nettie into ankle–deep, then knee–deep water. She was excited about the catch and dared not let go. She also was becoming a little frightened.</div><div class="paragraph">     "Papa, Papa, I've got a big one!" she cried. "It's pulling me into the river!" Her voice was lost in the evening breeze that stirred the rushes. "Papa, can't you hear me?"</div><div class="paragraph">     How much longer could she hold on? She used all her strength. Her shoulders ached from the strain. "Help! Help!" she shouted to anyone who might hear her. She turned her body so that the line wrapped around her hips. Her legs sank deeper into the sandy bottom. Muddy water billowed out her full skirt. "I'm like an umbrella," she laughed to herself. "Now maybe they'll see me."</div><div class="paragraph">     Fresh fish or dry salt bacon: the very thought gave her extra endurance. Not just for her own family, but the other wagon people who were also hungry for a change in diet. Drawing a deeper breath, she called hoarsely, "Save me! Save my fish!"</div><div class="paragraph">     An answering shout gave her courage. She heard footsteps splashing nearer. "Blackie, hold on. Pull back," called her father. Other men dropped their poles and ran to help. Josiah Emory placed his body in front of his little girl's, grabbing the line with his strong hands. Nettie clung to the pole while her father slowly, steadily, pulled in the line. Soon a flashing, grey body flapped in and out of the water. "It's a big catfish, Blackie, a really huge one. Good girl! I'm proud of you." Only then did Nettie let go. He lifted the pole with a grunt at the unexpected weight. Indeed, it was a huge fish. Her father guessed it was over three feet long and more than twenty-five pounds.</div><div class="paragraph">     Sloshing back to the wagon, muddy and exhausted, Nettie wondered what her mother would say. Her dress and petticoats were caked with red mud. Her shoes squished water through the laces. Now perhaps I can go barefoot until my shoes dry, she thought. She hoped her mother would be so glad over the fish that she wouldn't scold.</div><div class="paragraph">     News of Nettie's big catch spread among the wagons. A hungry crowd gathered to watch while Nettie's father dressed the fish. "Build up the fire," he said. "We'll all feast tonight. No ration of salt pork but fresh fish for all."</div><div class="paragraph">     "And biscuits and syrup instead of corn bread?" Nettie asked her mother.</div><div class="paragraph">     "Yes, Minette. All the biscuits and syrup and fish you can eat."</div><div class="paragraph">     Nettie grinned a happy, tired grin. "I'll always remember how that fish almost swam away with me. I am going to write about it in my diary."</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">A Note from the Author:</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">     This is a true story. A copy of Nettie Emory's diary was given to me by her granddaughter. From Nettie's entries about her trip on the Oregon Trail, written in 1863, I have retold her exciting adventure with the big fish. Of course I used imaginary conversation and descriptions. This is what Nettie wrote in her diary:</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">     "I was allowed to fish with the men in the Missouri River. Suddenly a fish took my bait, and I was pulled to the water's edge. My father heard my call for help. He began to run when he saw me splashing in the water.

The conversation revolves on Mary's and Warren's different perspectives of Silas' return. While Mary feels compassion for Silas, Warren still resents Silas for leaving during a busy haying season. Mary assures her husband that Silas won't leave him again for he has come home to die.

Primarily composed of a dialogue between Mary and her husband, Warren, the poem recounts the return of Silas, the hired man of the title, to their farm where he has worked intermittently over the years. In the course of their conversation, the reader learns about Silas' erratic work habits, his difficult familial relations, and his sense of the farm as home. The conversation revolves on Mary's and Warren's different perspectives of Silas' return. While Mary feels compassion for Silas, Warren still resents Silas for leaving during a busy haying season. Mary assures her husband that Silas won't leave him again for he has come home to die. After some discussion on the meaning of the word "home,"Warren relents and goes into the house to speak to Silas. When he quickly returns, Mary questions him and Warren replies with a single word-"dead."</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><br>269. <div class="paragraph">Mary meets Warren at the door and tells him that Silas is back so that</div></div><div class="distractors"><div>A. <span class="itemtext"><span>they can go to the market for some tobacco</span></span></div>

At Lexington, a handful of "embattled farmers," who had been tipped off by Paul Revere, barred the way. The "rebels"were ordered to disperse. They stood their ground. The English fired a volley of shots that killed eight patriots. It was not long before the swift riding Paul Revere spread the news of this new atrocity to the neighboring colonies. The patriots of all of New England, although still a handful, were now ready to fight the English. Even in faraway North Carolina, patriots organized to resist them.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="attrib"><div class="paragraph">Samuel Steinberg, <span class="stressed_text_2">The United States:</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2">Story of a Free People</span> (1963)</div></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">Passage B</span></div><div class="paragraph">     At five o'clock in the morning the local militia of Lexington, seventy strong, formed up on the village green. As the sun rose the head of the British column, with three officers riding in front, came into view. The leading officer, brandishing his sword, shouted, "Disperse, you rebels, immediately!"</div><div class="paragraph">     The militia commander ordered his men to disperse. The colonial committees were very anxious not to fire the first shot, and there were strict orders not to provoke open conflict with the British regulars. But in the confusion someone fired. A volley was returned. The ranks of the militia were thinned and there was a general <span class="stressed_text_2">melee.</span> Brushing aside the survivors, the British column marched on to Concord.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="attrib"><div class="paragraph">Winston Churchill,<span class="stressed_text_2">History of</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_2"> the English Speaking Peoples</span> (1957)</div></div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">Passage C</span></div><div class="paragraph">     The British troops approached us rapidly in platoons, with a General officer on horse-back at their head.

The officer then swung his sword, and said, "Lay down your arms, you damn'd rebels, or you are all dead men—fire." Some guns were fired by the British at us from the first platoon, but no person was killed or hurt, being probably charged only with powder. Just at this time, Captain Parker ordered every man to take care of himself. The company immediately dispersed; and while the company was dispersing and leaping over the wall, the second platoon of the British fired, and killed some of our men.

Each of the two passages was taken from a different source; the first is from a soldier's journal and the second is from an encyclopedia. Read them and see how each passage makes a contribution to your understanding of the battle of Shiloh and the Civil War. Think about what each source tells you that is missing from the other source, as well as what each one leaves out.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">Journal Entry — Passage 1</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_2">      The following journal entry relates the noise, confusion, and horror of the battle of Shiloh as told by a Union officer.</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      On the evening of the 5th, the 18th Wisconsin infantry arrived and were assigned to General Prentiss's division, on the front. They cooked their first suppers in the field that night at nine o'clock, and wrapped themselves in their blankets, to be awakened by the roar of battle, and receive, thus early, their bloody baptism. Before they had been on the field one day, their magnificent corps was decimated, most of the officers killed.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      On going to the field the second day, our regiment strode on in line over wounded, dying, and dead. My office detaching me from the lines, I had an opportunity to notice incidents about the field. The regiment halted amidst a gory, ghastly scene. I heard a voice calling, "Ho, friend! ho! Come here." I went to a pile of dead human forms in every kind of stiff contortion; I saw one arm raised, beckoning me. I found there a rebel, covered with blood, pillowing his head on the dead body of a comrade. Both were red from head to foot. The live one had lain across the dead one all that horrible, long night in the storm. The first thing he said to me was "Give me some water. Send me a surgeon—won't you! What made you come down here to fight us? We never would have come up there." And then he affectionately put one arm over the form, and laid his bloody face against the cold, clammy, bloody face of his friend.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      I filled his canteen nearly—reserving some for myself—knowing that I might be in the same sad condition. I told him we had no surgeon in our regiment, and that we would have to suffer, if wounded, the same as he; that other regiments were coming, and to call on them for surgeon; that they were humane.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "Forward!" shouted the Colonel; and 'Forward' was repeated by the officers. I left him.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The above recalls to mind one of the hardest principles in warfare—where your sympathy and humanity are appealed to, and from sense of expediency, you are forbidden to exercise it. After our regiment had been nearly annihilated, and were compelled to retreat under a galling fire, a boy was supporting his dying brother on one arm, and trying to drag him from the field and the advancing foe. He looked at me imploringly, and said, "Captain, help him—won't you? Do, Captain; he'll live." I said, "He's shot through the head; don't you see? and can't live—he's dying now." "Oh, no, he ain't, Captain. Don't leave me." I was forced to reply, "The rebels won't hurt him. Lay him down and come, or both you and I will be lost."The rush of bullets and the yells of the approaching enemy hurried me away—leaving the young soldier over his dying brother.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      At home I used to wince at the sight of a wound or of a corpse; but here, in one day, I learned to be among the scenes I am describing without emotion. My friend and myself, on the second night, looking in the dark for a place to lie down, he said, "Let's lie down here. Here's some fellows sleeping."We slept in quiet until dawn revealed that we had passed the night among sprawling, stiffened, ghastly corpses. I saw one of our dead soldiers with his mouth crammed full of cartridges until the cheeks were bulged out. Several protruded from his mouth. This was done by the rebels. On the third day most of our time was employed in burying the dead. Shallow pits were dug, which would soon fill with water. Into these we threw our comrades with a heavy splash, or a dump against solid bottom. Many a hopeful, promising youth thus indecently ended his career.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      I stood in one place in the woods near the spot of the engagement of the 57th Illinois, and counted eighty-one dead rebels. There I saw one tree, seven inches in diameter, with thirty-one bullet holes. Such had been death's storm. Near the scenes of the last of the fighting, where the rebels precipitately retreated, I saw one grave containing one hundred and thirty-seven dead rebels, and one side of it another grave containing forty-one dead Federals.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      One dead and uniformed officer lay covered with a little housing of rails. On it was a fly-leaf of a memorandum-book with the pencil writing: 'Federals, respect my father's corpse.' Many of our boys wanted to cut off his buttons and gold cord; but our Colonel had the body religiously guarded.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      My poor friend, Carson, after having fought and worked, and slaved from the beginning of the war, unrequited, comparatively, and after having passed hundreds of hair-breadth escapes, and through this wild battle was killed with almost the last shot. A round shot took off his whole face and tore part of his head. Poor Carson! We all remember your patriotism, your courage, your devotion. We will cheer, all we can, the bereaved and dear ones you have left.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:7.5pt">"Battle of Shiloh" from <span class="stressed_text_2">Civil War Eyewitness Reports,</span> ed. by H.E.

The first great battle of the war had been fought at Bull Run (Manassas) in Virginia in July 1861, nearly a year before. It had ended in a temporary stalemate in the eastern theater. In the West, Kentucky tried to remain neutral, but by the end of 1861, both sides had sent troops into the state.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      In February 1862, Union General Ulysses S. Grant captured forts Henry and Donelson on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in northern Tennessee near the Kentucky boundary, taking about 11,500 men and 40 guns. The whole Confederate line of defense across Kentucky gave way. The Confederates were forced to retreat to Murfreesboro, Tenn., southeast of Nashville, as other Union forces moved toward Nashville.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      With the Southern press clamoring for his removal, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, commanding the Confederate forces in the region, began to assemble the scattered troops. He decided to designate Corinth, in the northeast corner of Mississippi, as the concentration point for the army.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Assembling of the Armies.</span> By the end of March, Johnston and his second-in-command, Gen. Pierre G.T. Beauregard, managed to gather in Corinth more than 40,000 men, including a few units from as far away as the Gulf of Mexico. These were organized into three corps, commanded by Gens. Leonidas Polk, Braxton Bragg, and William J. Hardee. There was also a small reserve corps under Gen. John C. Breckinridge.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Meanwhile, Gen. Henry W. Halleck, who was Grant's department commander, had ordered Grant's troops to make a reconnaissance southward along the Tennessee River. They encamped near Pittsburg Landing, on the west side of the river, about 5 miles (8 km) north of the Mississippi boundary. There they awaited the arrival of another large Union force under Gen. Don Carlos Buell, which had been ordered southward from Nashville to join them.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Grant's army of 42,000 men was divided into six divisions. Five of these, a total of 37,000, were near Pittsburg Landing. One division, under Gen. Lew Wallace's command, was stationed 6 miles (9 km) to the north. Buell's army marching from Nashville was almost as large as Grant's; together they would far outnumber the concentration of forces that the Confederates could put in the field.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      General Johnston saw that he must strike Grant's army before Buell arrived. The Confederates started northward from Corinth on the afternoon of April 3, intending to attack at dawn on the 5th, but a violent rainstorm turned the dirt roads into a sea of mud. The attack was postponed from the 5th to Sunday, April 6, but on the 5th the leading division of Buell's army arrived on the other side of the Tennessee River, only 7 miles (11 km) away.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(56)" alt="The Battle of Shiloh Map Image" title="The Battle of Shiloh Map Image" height="594" width="400" align="middle"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      That night the armies encamped only 2 miles (3 km) apart, with the Union forces, whose advanced units were about 4 miles (6 km) away up the river, wholly unaware of their danger. Neither they nor their leaders expected an attack. They were not disposed for defense, nor had any trenches been dug for their protection. Early in the morning of April 6, a suspicious brigade commander in Gen. Benjamin M. Prentiss' Union division sent a small force forward to investigate the nearby woods. At dawn they exchanged shots with the Confederates, but it was too late to give warning of the attack, which burst on the Union camps.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Confederate Attack.</span> For the assault, General Johnston had chosen an unusual formation. He formed his troops in three lines, with Hardee's corps in front, Bragg's corps in a second parallel line, and then Polk's and Breckenridge's reserve corps.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The Confederates charged straight to their front into the divisions of Prestiss and Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, who held the right flank near the Old Shiloh Church. They and Gen. John A. McClernand's division made a brief stand. Many men fought valiantly, but others broke and fled. When Grant who had been absent from the field, arrived he found all five of the divisions fighting desperately in what seemed like a hopeless struggle. He had already sent for Buell's troops, and now he sent for Lew Wallace to join him.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The Union forces had retreated about halfway to the river to a new position, naturally strong, with open fields on each side and a sunken road in front. Here, in the center, in a position known to history as "The Hornets' Nest", the Confederates were halted for hours. They could not take it by assault, but gradually the Union troops on each flank were forced back. Johnston fell mortally wounded. Beauregard took command, and the attack continued.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Finally "The Hornets' Nest"was surrounded. Gen. William H.L. Wallace was killed trying to lead his division out. Prentiss was forced to surrender his division, but time was running out for the Confederates. They made a last attack on the Union left toward Pittsburg Landing to cut off the escape of the Union forces, but Buell's troops were now arriving.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Union Counterstroke.</span> On the next day, Grant attacked. Of the soldiers who had fought on the first day, he had only about 7,000 effectives, (soldiers ready for battle), but Lew Wallace had arrived with his 5,000 and Buell had supplied 20,000 more. To oppose these, the Confederates could muster only about 20,000 men. For hours they held the line in front of Shiloh Church, but at last they withdrew in good order from the field.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The Battle of Shiloh, second great battle of the war, was a tremendous shock to the people of the North and the South. When the reports were published, they found that each side had lost about 25% of the troops engaged—the Confederates about 10,700, the Union more than 13,000. The people suddenly realized that this was to be a long and bloody war.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><br>277. <div class="paragraph">The encyclopedia passage does which of the following?</div></div><div class="distractors"><div>A. <span class="itemtext"><span>Explains the battle's historical significance.</span></span></div>

They cooked their first suppers in the field that night at nine o'clock, and wrapped themselves in their blankets, to be awakened by the roar of battle, and receive, thus early, their bloody baptism. Before they had been on the field one day, their magnificent corps was decimated, most of the officers killed.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      On going to the field the second day, our regiment strode on in line over wounded, dying, and dead. My office detaching me from the lines, I had an opportunity to notice incidents about the field. The regiment halted amidst a gory, ghastly scene. I heard a voice calling, "Ho, friend! ho! Come here." I went to a pile of dead human forms in every kind of stiff contortion; I saw one arm raised, beckoning me. I found there a rebel, covered with blood, pillowing his head on the dead body of a comrade. Both were red from head to foot. The live one had lain across the dead one all that horrible, long night in the storm. The first thing he said to me was "Give me some water. Send me a surgeon—won't you! What made you come down here to fight us? We never would have come up there." And then he affectionately put one arm over the form, and laid his bloody face against the cold, clammy, bloody face of his friend.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      I filled his canteen nearly—reserving some for myself—knowing that I might be in the same sad condition. I told him we had no surgeon in our regiment, and that we would have to suffer, if wounded, the same as he; that other regiments were coming, and to call on them for surgeon; that they were humane.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "Forward!" shouted the Colonel; and 'Forward' was repeated by the officers. I left him.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The above recalls to mind one of the hardest principles in warfare—where your sympathy and humanity are appealed to, and from sense of expediency, you are forbidden to exercise it. After our regiment had been nearly annihilated, and were compelled to retreat under a galling fire, a boy was supporting his dying brother on one arm, and trying to drag him from the field and the advancing foe. He looked at me imploringly, and said, "Captain, help him—won't you? Do, Captain; he'll live." I said, "He's shot through the head; don't you see? and can't live—he's dying now." "Oh, no, he ain't, Captain. Don't leave me." I was forced to reply, "The rebels won't hurt him. Lay him down and come, or both you and I will be lost."The rush of bullets and the yells of the approaching enemy hurried me away—leaving the young soldier over his dying brother.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      At home I used to wince at the sight of a wound or of a corpse; but here, in one day, I learned to be among the scenes I am describing without emotion. My friend and myself, on the second night, looking in the dark for a place to lie down, he said, "Let's lie down here. Here's some fellows sleeping."We slept in quiet until dawn revealed that we had passed the night among sprawling, stiffened, ghastly corpses. I saw one of our dead soldiers with his mouth crammed full of cartridges until the cheeks were bulged out. Several protruded from his mouth. This was done by the rebels. On the third day most of our time was employed in burying the dead. Shallow pits were dug, which would soon fill with water. Into these we threw our comrades with a heavy splash, or a dump against solid bottom. Many a hopeful, promising youth thus indecently ended his career.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      I stood in one place in the woods near the spot of the engagement of the 57th Illinois, and counted eighty-one dead rebels. There I saw one tree, seven inches in diameter, with thirty-one bullet holes. Such had been death's storm. Near the scenes of the last of the fighting, where the rebels precipitately retreated, I saw one grave containing one hundred and thirty-seven dead rebels, and one side of it another grave containing forty-one dead Federals.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      One dead and uniformed officer lay covered with a little housing of rails. On it was a fly-leaf of a memorandum-book with the pencil writing: 'Federals, respect my father's corpse.' Many of our boys wanted to cut off his buttons and gold cord; but our Colonel had the body religiously guarded.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      My poor friend, Carson, after having fought and worked, and slaved from the beginning of the war, unrequited, comparatively, and after having passed hundreds of hair-breadth escapes, and through this wild battle was killed with almost the last shot. A round shot took off his whole face and tore part of his head. Poor Carson! We all remember your patriotism, your courage, your devotion. We will cheer, all we can, the bereaved and dear ones you have left.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:7.5pt">"Battle of Shiloh" from <span class="stressed_text_2">Civil War Eyewitness Reports,</span> ed. by H.E.

The first great battle of the war had been fought at Bull Run (Manassas) in Virginia in July 1861, nearly a year before. It had ended in a temporary stalemate in the eastern theater. In the West, Kentucky tried to remain neutral, but by the end of 1861, both sides had sent troops into the state.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      In February 1862, Union General Ulysses S. Grant captured forts Henry and Donelson on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in northern Tennessee near the Kentucky boundary, taking about 11,500 men and 40 guns. The whole Confederate line of defense across Kentucky gave way. The Confederates were forced to retreat to Murfreesboro, Tenn., southeast of Nashville, as other Union forces moved toward Nashville.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      With the Southern press clamoring for his removal, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, commanding the Confederate forces in the region, began to assemble the scattered troops. He decided to designate Corinth, in the northeast corner of Mississippi, as the concentration point for the army.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Assembling of the Armies.</span> By the end of March, Johnston and his second-in-command, Gen. Pierre G.T. Beauregard, managed to gather in Corinth more than 40,000 men, including a few units from as far away as the Gulf of Mexico. These were organized into three corps, commanded by Gens. Leonidas Polk, Braxton Bragg, and William J. Hardee. There was also a small reserve corps under Gen. John C. Breckinridge.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Meanwhile, Gen. Henry W. Halleck, who was Grant's department commander, had ordered Grant's troops to make a reconnaissance southward along the Tennessee River. They encamped near Pittsburg Landing, on the west side of the river, about 5 miles (8 km) north of the Mississippi boundary. There they awaited the arrival of another large Union force under Gen. Don Carlos Buell, which had been ordered southward from Nashville to join them.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Grant's army of 42,000 men was divided into six divisions. Five of these, a total of 37,000, were near Pittsburg Landing. One division, under Gen. Lew Wallace's command, was stationed 6 miles (9 km) to the north. Buell's army marching from Nashville was almost as large as Grant's; together they would far outnumber the concentration of forces that the Confederates could put in the field.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      General Johnston saw that he must strike Grant's army before Buell arrived. The Confederates started northward from Corinth on the afternoon of April 3, intending to attack at dawn on the 5th, but a violent rainstorm turned the dirt roads into a sea of mud. The attack was postponed from the 5th to Sunday, April 6, but on the 5th the leading division of Buell's army arrived on the other side of the Tennessee River, only 7 miles (11 km) away.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(56)" alt="The Battle of Shiloh Map Image" title="The Battle of Shiloh Map Image" height="594" width="400" align="middle"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      That night the armies encamped only 2 miles (3 km) apart, with the Union forces, whose advanced units were about 4 miles (6 km) away up the river, wholly unaware of their danger. Neither they nor their leaders expected an attack. They were not disposed for defense, nor had any trenches been dug for their protection. Early in the morning of April 6, a suspicious brigade commander in Gen. Benjamin M. Prentiss' Union division sent a small force forward to investigate the nearby woods. At dawn they exchanged shots with the Confederates, but it was too late to give warning of the attack, which burst on the Union camps.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Confederate Attack.</span> For the assault, General Johnston had chosen an unusual formation. He formed his troops in three lines, with Hardee's corps in front, Bragg's corps in a second parallel line, and then Polk's and Breckenridge's reserve corps.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The Confederates charged straight to their front into the divisions of Prestiss and Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, who held the right flank near the Old Shiloh Church. They and Gen. John A. McClernand's division made a brief stand. Many men fought valiantly, but others broke and fled. When Grant who had been absent from the field, arrived he found all five of the divisions fighting desperately in what seemed like a hopeless struggle. He had already sent for Buell's troops, and now he sent for Lew Wallace to join him.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The Union forces had retreated about halfway to the river to a new position, naturally strong, with open fields on each side and a sunken road in front. Here, in the center, in a position known to history as "The Hornets' Nest", the Confederates were halted for hours. They could not take it by assault, but gradually the Union troops on each flank were forced back. Johnston fell mortally wounded. Beauregard took command, and the attack continued.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Finally "The Hornets' Nest"was surrounded. Gen. William H.L. Wallace was killed trying to lead his division out. Prentiss was forced to surrender his division, but time was running out for the Confederates. They made a last attack on the Union left toward Pittsburg Landing to cut off the escape of the Union forces, but Buell's troops were now arriving.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Union Counterstroke.</span> On the next day, Grant attacked. Of the soldiers who had fought on the first day, he had only about 7,000 effectives, (soldiers ready for battle), but Lew Wallace had arrived with his 5,000 and Buell had supplied 20,000 more. To oppose these, the Confederates could muster only about 20,000 men. For hours they held the line in front of Shiloh Church, but at last they withdrew in good order from the field.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The Battle of Shiloh, second great battle of the war, was a tremendous shock to the people of the North and the South. When the reports were published, they found that each side had lost about 25% of the troops engaged—the Confederates about 10,700, the Union more than 13,000. The people suddenly realized that this was to be a long and bloody war.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><br>278. <div class="paragraph">Which would be the best title for the journal entry?</div></div><div class="distractors"><div>A. <span class="itemtext"><span>My Life and Times as a Union Officer</span></span></div>

The attack was postponed from the 5th to Sunday, April 6, but on the 5th the leading division of Buell's army arrived on the other side of the Tennessee River, only 7 miles (11 km) away.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center"><img src="./ReadEasy_files/ItemResource(56)" alt="The Battle of Shiloh Map Image" title="The Battle of Shiloh Map Image" height="594" width="400" align="middle"></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      That night the armies encamped only 2 miles (3 km) apart, with the Union forces, whose advanced units were about 4 miles (6 km) away up the river, wholly unaware of their danger. Neither they nor their leaders expected an attack. They were not disposed for defense, nor had any trenches been dug for their protection. Early in the morning of April 6, a suspicious brigade commander in Gen. Benjamin M. Prentiss' Union division sent a small force forward to investigate the nearby woods. At dawn they exchanged shots with the Confederates, but it was too late to give warning of the attack, which burst on the Union camps.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Confederate Attack.</span> For the assault, General Johnston had chosen an unusual formation. He formed his troops in three lines, with Hardee's corps in front, Bragg's corps in a second parallel line, and then Polk's and Breckenridge's reserve corps.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The Confederates charged straight to their front into the divisions of Prestiss and Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, who held the right flank near the Old Shiloh Church. They and Gen. John A. McClernand's division made a brief stand. Many men fought valiantly, but others broke and fled. When Grant who had been absent from the field, arrived he found all five of the divisions fighting desperately in what seemed like a hopeless struggle. He had already sent for Buell's troops, and now he sent for Lew Wallace to join him.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The Union forces had retreated about halfway to the river to a new position, naturally strong, with open fields on each side and a sunken road in front. Here, in the center, in a position known to history as "The Hornets' Nest", the Confederates were halted for hours. They could not take it by assault, but gradually the Union troops on each flank were forced back. Johnston fell mortally wounded. Beauregard took command, and the attack continued.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Finally "The Hornets' Nest"was surrounded. Gen. William H.L. Wallace was killed trying to lead his division out. Prentiss was forced to surrender his division, but time was running out for the Confederates. They made a last attack on the Union left toward Pittsburg Landing to cut off the escape of the Union forces, but Buell's troops were now arriving.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Union Counterstroke.</span> On the next day, Grant attacked. Of the soldiers who had fought on the first day, he had only about 7,000 effectives, (soldiers ready for battle), but Lew Wallace had arrived with his 5,000 and Buell had supplied 20,000 more. To oppose these, the Confederates could muster only about 20,000 men. For hours they held the line in front of Shiloh Church, but at last they withdrew in good order from the field.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The Battle of Shiloh, second great battle of the war, was a tremendous shock to the people of the North and the South. When the reports were published, they found that each side had lost about 25% of the troops engaged—the Confederates about 10,700, the Union more than 13,000. The people suddenly realized that this was to be a long and bloody war.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><br>279. <div class="paragraph">"The Hornets' Nest" most likely received its name because it was</div></div><div class="distractors"><div>A. <span class="itemtext"><span>inhabited by stinging insects</span></span></div>

Each of the two passages was taken from a different source; the first is from a soldier's journal and the second is from an encyclopedia. Read them and see how each passage makes a contribution to your understanding of the battle of Shiloh and the Civil War. Think about what each source tells you that is missing from the other source, as well as what each one leaves out.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="stressed_text_1">Journal Entry — Passage 1</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_2">      The following journal entry relates the noise, confusion, and horror of the battle of Shiloh as told by a Union officer.</span></div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      On the evening of the 5th, the 18th Wisconsin infantry arrived and were assigned to General Prentiss's division, on the front. They cooked their first suppers in the field that night at nine o'clock, and wrapped themselves in their blankets, to be awakened by the roar of battle, and receive, thus early, their bloody baptism. Before they had been on the field one day, their magnificent corps was decimated, most of the officers killed.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      On going to the field the second day, our regiment strode on in line over wounded, dying, and dead. My office detaching me from the lines, I had an opportunity to notice incidents about the field. The regiment halted amidst a gory, ghastly scene. I heard a voice calling, "Ho, friend! ho! Come here." I went to a pile of dead human forms in every kind of stiff contortion; I saw one arm raised, beckoning me. I found there a rebel, covered with blood, pillowing his head on the dead body of a comrade. Both were red from head to foot. The live one had lain across the dead one all that horrible, long night in the storm. The first thing he said to me was "Give me some water. Send me a surgeon—won't you! What made you come down here to fight us? We never would have come up there." And then he affectionately put one arm over the form, and laid his bloody face against the cold, clammy, bloody face of his friend.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      I filled his canteen nearly—reserving some for myself—knowing that I might be in the same sad condition. I told him we had no surgeon in our regiment, and that we would have to suffer, if wounded, the same as he; that other regiments were coming, and to call on them for surgeon; that they were humane.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      "Forward!" shouted the Colonel; and 'Forward' was repeated by the officers. I left him.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      The above recalls to mind one of the hardest principles in warfare—where your sympathy and humanity are appealed to, and from sense of expediency, you are forbidden to exercise it. After our regiment had been nearly annihilated, and were compelled to retreat under a galling fire, a boy was supporting his dying brother on one arm, and trying to drag him from the field and the advancing foe. He looked at me imploringly, and said, "Captain, help him—won't you? Do, Captain; he'll live." I said, "He's shot through the head; don't you see? and can't live—he's dying now." "Oh, no, he ain't, Captain. Don't leave me." I was forced to reply, "The rebels won't hurt him. Lay him down and come, or both you and I will be lost."The rush of bullets and the yells of the approaching enemy hurried me away—leaving the young soldier over his dying brother.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      At home I used to wince at the sight of a wound or of a corpse; but here, in one day, I learned to be among the scenes I am describing without emotion. My friend and myself, on the second night, looking in the dark for a place to lie down, he said, "Let's lie down here. Here's some fellows sleeping."We slept in quiet until dawn revealed that we had passed the night among sprawling, stiffened, ghastly corpses. I saw one of our dead soldiers with his mouth crammed full of cartridges until the cheeks were bulged out. Several protruded from his mouth. This was done by the rebels. On the third day most of our time was employed in burying the dead. Shallow pits were dug, which would soon fill with water. Into these we threw our comrades with a heavy splash, or a dump against solid bottom. Many a hopeful, promising youth thus indecently ended his career.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      I stood in one place in the woods near the spot of the engagement of the 57th Illinois, and counted eighty-one dead rebels. There I saw one tree, seven inches in diameter, with thirty-one bullet holes. Such had been death's storm. Near the scenes of the last of the fighting, where the rebels precipitately retreated, I saw one grave containing one hundred and thirty-seven dead rebels, and one side of it another grave containing forty-one dead Federals.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      One dead and uniformed officer lay covered with a little housing of rails. On it was a fly-leaf of a memorandum-book with the pencil writing: 'Federals, respect my father's corpse.' Many of our boys wanted to cut off his buttons and gold cord; but our Colonel had the body religiously guarded.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      My poor friend, Carson, after having fought and worked, and slaved from the beginning of the war, unrequited, comparatively, and after having passed hundreds of hair-breadth escapes, and through this wild battle was killed with almost the last shot. A round shot took off his whole face and tore part of his head. Poor Carson! We all remember your patriotism, your courage, your devotion. We will cheer, all we can, the bereaved and dear ones you have left.</div><div class="paragraph"></div><div class="paragraph" style="font-size:7.5pt">"Battle of Shiloh" from <span class="stressed_text_2">Civil War Eyewitness Reports,</span> ed. by H.E.

The first great battle of the war had been fought at Bull Run (Manassas) in Virginia in July 1861, nearly a year before. It had ended in a temporary stalemate in the eastern theater. In the West, Kentucky tried to remain neutral, but by the end of 1861, both sides had sent troops into the state.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      In February 1862, Union General Ulysses S. Grant captured forts Henry and Donelson on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in northern Tennessee near the Kentucky boundary, taking about 11,500 men and 40 guns. The whole Confederate line of defense across Kentucky gave way. The Confederates were forced to retreat to Murfreesboro, Tenn., southeast of Nashville, as other Union forces moved toward Nashville.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      With the Southern press clamoring for his removal, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, commanding the Confederate forces in the region, began to assemble the scattered troops. He decided to designate Corinth, in the northeast corner of Mississippi, as the concentration point for the army.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px"><span class="stressed_text_1">Assembling of the Armies.</span> By the end of March, Johnston and his second-in-command, Gen. Pierre G.T. Beauregard, managed to gather in Corinth more than 40,000 men, including a few units from as far away as the Gulf of Mexico. These were organized into three corps, commanded by Gens. Leonidas Polk, Braxton Bragg, and William J. Hardee. There was also a small reserve corps under Gen. John C. Breckinridge.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Meanwhile, Gen. Henry W. Halleck, who was Grant's department commander, had ordered Grant's troops to make a reconnaissance southward along the Tennessee River. They encamped near Pittsburg Landing, on the west side of the river, about 5 miles (8 km) north of the Mississippi boundary. There they awaited the arrival of another large Union force under Gen. Don Carlos Buell, which had been ordered southward from Nashville to join them.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      Grant's army of 42,000 men was divided into six divisions. Five of these, a total of 37,000, were near Pittsburg Landing. One division, under Gen. Lew Wallace's command, was stationed 6 miles (9 km) to the north. Buell's army marching from Nashville was almost as large as Grant's; together they would far outnumber the concentration of forces that the Confederates could put in the field.</div><div class="paragraph" style="text-indent:15px">      General Johnston saw that he must strike Grant's army before Buell arrived.
