              LANCASTER, Pa.—Morning, and the delicacies at Burnside Donuts are fresh and warm—58 varieties, from glazed to pudding-filled to chocolate-covered, at just 35 cents apiece. Lara Dailey, 2 1/2, goes straight for the old-fashioned kind—spongy and golden brown, dredged in powdered sugar.

              Dunk. A perfectly respectable English word, except that it entered the language via a foreign tongue—Pennsylvania German, the native language of the Amish and Mennonites who settled and cultivated this region of southeastern Pennsylvania farmland.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              This is English at its most colorful—a language spoken by multitudes, able and willing to assimilate any words it finds useful.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              ""It's always been a vacuum cleaner of a language. It sucks in words from everywhere,"" said David Crystal, author of the <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language</span>.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              Places, peoples, tongues from around the world: all are hidden in the folds of English's lexicons, co-existing in a polyglot that makes its vocabulary more malleable and gives a sense of belonging to those who speak it as a second or foreign language.

              Consider this unlikely but perfectly serviceable sentence: ""You've got some chutzpah taking the ketchup I was going to use on my barbecued hamburger, you skunk!""

              Flawless English. Yet ""chutzpah"" is Yiddish, ""ketchup"" originally Chinese, ""barbecue"" Caribbean, ""hamburger"" German and ""skunk"" Native American. All folded into English.

              From all corners they come, these words. From Swedish (ombudsman and dynamite) and Basque (bizarre). From Yiddish (meshuganeh and kibbitzing) and Spanish (siesta and coyote). From Finnish (sauna), Russian (apparatchik), Hindi (juggernaut), Sri Lankan Sinhala (anaconda) and Malay (amok). From Japanese (judo), Filipino Tagalog (boondocks) and Arabic via Swahili (safari). According to the <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Oxford English Dictionary</span>, English contains words from more than 350 living languages.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              ""English is a free market,"" said Allan Metcalf, author of The World in So Many Words, a freewheeling exploration of English's imports. ""Other languages are homogeneous enough that you can notice foreign words coming in and say, 'That's a terrible thing; keep them out.' But English is multicultural.""
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              Viking languages contributed words and grammar to Old English in England's earliest days, but linguists trace the real dawn of importation to 1066, when King William, a Norman from what is now France, conquered England. That meant English speakers were being ruled by French speakers, and the subjugated language had to adjust.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              The conquerors considered themselves more genteel than the low-country Anglo-Saxons. Animal words—cow, pig, sheep—are out-in-the-barn Anglo-Saxon. Food words for the same beasts—beef, pork, mutton—come from dress-up-for-dinner Norman.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              By Chaucer's time, 300 years later, Middle English had swelled with French terms such as ""reign,"" ""jurisprudence"" and ""reason,"" setting a precedent: new words could be foreign and still sound English.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              During the Renaissance, words flowed in from Latin—not that different from French—and Greek. The Age of Exploration introduced novel terms from all corners. English was becoming a polyglot.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              And the United States changed everything. Here was an English-speaking land molded by successive generations of immigrants, each bringing new ideas and new expressions. Irish, Italians, Germans, Eastern Europeans, Latinos, Africans, Asians—all changed English in ways minuscule and momentous.

              Today, a family of Norwegian descent in Minot, North Dakota, can watch ""Seinfeld"" and understand its New Yorkstyle Yiddish references. Words such as ""schtick"" and ""pastrami"" and ""bagel"" are no longer Eastern European Jewish regionalisms; they've gone mainstream.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              ""Dunk"" owes its origin to German immigrants who belonged to the 18th-century Brethren movement and moved to Pennsylvania to escape religious persecution. They practiced full-immersion Baptism and were known as ""tunker;' from the German word ""tunken,"" meaning ""to immerse."" The ""T"" evolved into a ""D"" in Pennsylvania.
            </div><div class=""paragraph"">
              Linguists predict foreign words will flow into English even faster as more non-native speakers reach global leadership positions. The pace will increase, but it will still be English—willing to accept words into its mosaic because of a stubborn legacy of pragmatism nearly 1,000 years old.

The trip gave White a lifetime of anecdotes, and spawned a legend or two.

Borrowing his brother's typewriter, he began pounding out sketches and poems. On a lark, he sent some essays to a fledgling magazine called <span class=""stressed_text_2"">The New Yorker</span>. Since its founding in 1925, the magazine had struggled to find its niche, and White's work helped put <span class=""stressed_text_2"">The New Yorker</span> on the map. His essays were funny and sophisticated; they spoke equally to socialites and cab drivers, professors and plumbers.

He moved from New York to a farm in Maine, where he raised chickens and geese. Seeking a way to amuse his nieces and nephews, White started to write stories for them. ""Children were always after me to tell them a story and I found I couldn't do it,"" he said. ""So I had to get it down on paper.""</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">A vivid dream about a mouselike character led to <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Stuart Little</span>.

We encountered better luck than we had bargained for.</span> The cow moose and her young one were standing near the wall of the deer park below the monkey house, and in order to get a better view we strolled down to the lower end of the park, by the brook. The path there is not much traveled. As we approached the corner where the brook trickles under the wire fence, we noticed a red deer getting to her feet. Beside her, on legs that were just learning their business, was a spotted fawn, as small and perfect as a trinket seen through a reducing glass. They stood there, mother and child, under a gray beech whose trunk was engraved with dozens of hearts and initials.

His family was prosperous, and White was raised with the mix of sophistication and common sense that would mark his writing.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">After graduation from Cornell University, White spent a year as a newspaper reporter in New York City, then decided to drive across the country with a friend in a Model T Ford. The trip gave White a lifetime of anecdotes, and spawned a legend or two.

Since its founding in 1925, the magazine had struggled to find its niche, and White's work helped put <span class=""stressed_text_2"">The New Yorker</span> on the map. His essays were funny and sophisticated; they spoke equally to socialites and cab drivers, professors and plumbers.

We peered into the sparse scrub along the roadside and searched for the brown furry animals. In the distance we spotted a mob of red kangaroos bouncing out of sight, and near the road a crowlike bird called a currawong was perched, but nowhere did we see any wombats. However, we later found out that this was not surprising because we were traveling during midday, and wombats are active mostly at night. It wasn't until we visited the animal reserve that we finally saw our first wombat and learned more about this funny-looking creature.</div><div class=""paragraph"">We found that there are two types of wombats in Australia: the hairy-nosed wombat, which lives in Queensland and South Australia, and the coarse-haired wombat, which lives along the southeast coast. Both have soft brown fur, short ears, and thick-set bodies. They are said to resemble North American badgers. The hairy-nosed wombat is smaller and has pointier ears compared to its coarse-haired cousin; otherwise they are very much alike.</div><div class=""paragraph"">In many ways the wombat is similar to another Australian native, the koala. Like koalas, wombats have strong forelimbs and powerful claws. But instead of using its claws to cling to high tree branches as the koala does, the wombat digs large underground burrows. These burrows are usually nine to fifteen feet across, but they can be enormous — sometimes as long as ninety feet. One end of the burrow is used as a sleeping area — there the wombat builds a nest made of bark.</div><div class=""paragraph"">The wombat is a vegetarian, so it also uses its mighty claws to tear up grasses and roots for its food. A mother wombat will pull out single stems of grass and lay them on the ground so her young wombat can eat the tender bases. The wombat's teeth, which grow throughout its life, are sharp and ideal for cutting and tearing.</div><div class=""paragraph"">When a mother wombat gives birth, she never has to worry about finding a baby-sitter — she simply carries her baby along with her. Like most mammals in Australia, wombats are marsupials. A baby wombat is born at a very early stage of development and lives in its mother's pouch until it is old enough to survive on its own.</div><img align=""middle"" alt=""Sign that says Caution Wombat Crossing"" height=""234"" src=""./ReadHard_files/ItemResource(7)"" title=""Sign that says Caution Wombat Crossing"" width=""234""><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">Wombats have only one baby at a time, usually during the Australian winter months, May to July. A baby wombat is called a joey. At birth the tiny joey — barely an inch long — uses its forelimbs to pull itself along its mother's underside to get into her pouch, where it will be kept warm, protected, and fed.</div><div class=""paragraph"">Marsupials, like all mammals, are nourished by their mothers' milk. The nipples that supply the milk are inside the pouch. Once inside, the wombat joey finds a nipple and grabs it. The nipple then swells up in the baby's mouth, providing a firm hold and a steady supply of food. The joey stays in its mother's pouch for the next four months and grows rapidly.</div><div class=""paragraph"">Most marsupials have pouches which open upward when the animal is standing. However, both koalas and wombats have pouches which face downwards. A strong muscle keeps the pouch tightly closed and prevents the young wombat or koala from falling out. An advantage of the downward-opening pouch for wombats is that dirt is less likely to get inside when the wombat is burrowing.</div><div class=""paragraph"">The wombat is a shy and gentle animal. But even if you lived in Australia and were willing to keep watch during the nighttime hours, it would be difficult to get to know one. As more and more people move into territories in which wombats live, they destroy the wombat's burrows and food supplies. In some areas where the wombat was once plentiful, it is now almost extinct. Animal reserves have been set up recently to protect the wombat. Perhaps with a little help these friendly creatures will again prosper and multiply. The next time we drive through Australia, we really may have to <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Watch Out for Wombats</span>!</div><div class=""paragraph"">Reprinted by permission of Caroline Arnold.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div></img></div></div></div><br>18. <div class=""paragraph"">This article mostly describes how</div></br></div><div class=""distractors""><div>A. <span class=""itemtext""><span>the wombat's special body parts help it to grow and live</span></span></div>

The tip of your nose tingles in the frosty air. Finally, you climb into bed and find the toasty treat you have been waiting for—your very own hot brick.</div><div class=""paragraph"">If you had lived in colonial days, that would not sound as strange as it does today. Winters were hard in this New World, and the colonists had to think of clever ways to fight the cold. At bedtime, they heated soapstones, or bricks, in the fireplace. They wrapped the bricks in cloths and tucked them into their beds. The brick kept them warm at night, at least for as long as its heat lasted.</div><div class=""paragraph"">Before the colonists slipped into bed, they rubbed their icy sheets with a bed warmer. This was a metal pan with a long wooden handle. The pan held hot embers from the fireplace. It warmed the bedding so well that sleepy bodies had to wait until the sheets cooled before climbing in.</div><div class=""paragraph"">Staying warm wasn't just a bedtime problem. On winter rides, colonial travelers covered themselves with animal skins and warm blankets. Tucked under the blankets, near their feet, were small tin boxes called foot stoves. A foot stove held burning coals. Hot smoke puffed from small holes in the stove's lid, soothing freezing feet and legs. When the colonists went to Sunday services, their foot stoves, furs, and blankets went with them. The meeting houses had no heat of their own until the 1800s.</div><div class=""paragraph"">At home, colonial families huddled close to the fireplace, or hearth. The fireplace was wide and high enough to hold a large fire, but its chimney was large, too. That caused a problem: Gusts of cold air blew into the house. The area near the fire was warm, but in the rest of the room it might still be cold enough to see your breath.</div><div class=""paragraph"">Reading or needlework was done by candlelight, or by the light of the fire. During the winter, animal skins sealed the drafty windows of some cabins and blocked out the daylight. The living area inside was gloomy, except in the circle of light at the hearth.</div><div class=""paragraph"">Early Americans did not bathe as often as we do. When they did, their ""bathroom"" was the kitchen, in that toasty space by the hearth. They partially filled a tub with cold water, then warmed it up with water heated in the fireplace. A blanket draped from chairs for privacy also let the fire's warmth surround the bather.</div><div class=""paragraph"">The household cooks spent hours at the hearth. They stirred the kettle of corn pudding or checked the baking bread while the rest of the family carried on their own fireside activities. So you can see why the fireplace was the center of a colonial home.</div><div class=""paragraph"">The only time the fire was allowed to die down was at bedtime. Ashes would be piled over the fire, reducing it to embers that might glow until morning.</div><div class=""paragraph"">By sunrise, the hot brick had become a cold stone once more. An early riser might get dressed under the covers, then hurry to the hearth to warm up.</div><div class=""paragraph"">Maybe you'd enjoy hearing someone who kept warm in these ways tell you what it was like. You wouldn't need to look for someone who has been living for two hundred years. In many parts of the country the modern ways didn't take over from the old ones until recently. Your own grandparents or other older people might remember the warmth of a hearthside and the joy of having a brick to cuddle up to.</div><div class=""paragraph"">""A Brick to Cuddle Up To"" by Barbara Cole, illustrated by Katharine Dodge, from <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Highlights for Children</span>, Dec. 1991, copyright (c) Highlights for Children,Inc., Columbus, Ohio.

In order to illustrate his point to the inventor, the Emperor shows an invention of his own that mirrors the natural world: a wind-up box containing small trees and miniature flying birds. The inventor tries to convince the Emperor that his flying machine, like the Emperor's invention, is a thing of beauty. The Emperor, however, chooses to protect the peace of his dominion from the possibility of future invasion, and sacrifices the momentary beauty provided by the flying machine. The story ends with the Emperor enjoying the peaceful miniature world inside his wind-up box.</div>________________________________________<div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"">* We did not receive copyright approval to put the actual text from the student booklet on the Website.

Amanda Clement was sixteen years old. She sat quietly in the grandstand with her mother, but she imagined herself right out there on the baseball diamond with the players. Back home in Hudson, South Dakota, her brother Hank and his friends often asked her to umpire games. Sometimes she was even allowed to play first base.</div><div>     Today, Mandy, as she was called, could only sit and watch Hank pitch for Renville against Hawarden. The year was 1904, and girls were not supposed to participate in sports. But when the umpire for the preliminary game between two local teams didn't arrive, Hank asked Mandy to make the calls.</div><div>     Mrs. Clement didn't want her daughter to umpire a public event, but at last Hank and Mandy persuaded her to give her consent. Mandy eagerly took her position behind the pitcher's mound. Because only one umpire was used in those days, she had to call plays on the four bases as well as strikes and balls.</div><div>     Mandy was five feet ten inches tall and looked very impressive as she accurately called the plays. She did so well that the players for the big game asked her to umpire for them — with pay!</div><div>     Mrs. Clement was shocked at that idea. But Mandy finally persuaded her mother to allow her to do it. Amanda Clement became the first paid woman baseball umpire on record.</div><div>     Mandy's fame spread quickly. Before long, she was umpiring games in North and South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska. Flyers, sent out to announce upcoming games, called Mandy the ""World Champion Woman Umpire."" Her uniform was a long blue skirt, a black necktie, and a white blouse with UMPS stenciled across the front. Mandy kept her long dark hair tucked inside a peaked cap. She commanded respect and attention — players never said, ""Kill the umpire!"" They argued more politely, asking, ""Beg your pardon, Miss Umpire, but wasn't that one a bit high?""</div><div>     Mandy is recognized in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York; the Women's Sports Hall of Fame; and Women's Sports foundation in San Francisco, California. In 1912 she held the world record for a woman throwing a baseball: 279 feet.</div><div>     Mandy's earning for her work as an umpire came in especially handy. She put herself through college and became a teacher and coach, organizing teams and encouraging athletes wherever she lived. Mandy died in 1971. People who knew her remember her for her work as an umpire, teacher, and coach, and because she loved helping people as much as she loved sports.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""font-size:8pt;line-height:95%"">""Amanda Clement: The Umpire in a Skirt"", by Marilyn Kratz.

"<div class=""answer"">The correct answer is:<div>D. <span class=""itemtext""><span>a ""slice of life"" from along the Oregon Trail</span></span></div>
</div>",D,4.0,"<div class=""questionwrapper""><div class=""question""><div class=""stimulus""><div class=""stimlabel"">Reading Passage</div><div class=""paragraph""><div class=""prose1""><table align=""center"" border=""1"" cellpadding=""5"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""background-color:#f0f0f0"" width=""400""><tbody><tr><td><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-align:center""><span class=""font-size:140%""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">The Oregon Trail</span></span></div><div class=""paragraph"">     Americans have long been thought of as a restless group of people. They seem to have always been on the move, searching for a better place to live. From America's first colonies small groups of people uprooted themselves, migrating westward to look for better farmland. They built pioneer roads, or trails, such as the Cumberland Road that led into the Ohio Valley, and the Genesee Road that led across New York to the shores of Lake Erie. Many of these roads and trails have disappeared. Others can still be traced, revealing artifacts along the way that help us to recreate their story.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The Oregon Trail is one of these trails. Even today you can retrace its path, walking beside wagon ruts that were gouged almost a century and a half ago. The Oregon Trail was different from the earlier trails and roads that had crossed the Appalachian Mountains in the East. It was longer and more difficult than most pioneers had experienced. Unlike the eastern trails, the Oregon Trail crossed nearly 2,000 miles of unfamiliar prairie, desert, and mountainous regions. There were no settlements along the way that could offer friendly hospitality, and emigrants couldn't scout out their new homeland before they moved there. Oregon Country was so far away, it took from four to six months to get there. When people moved there, they moved to stay.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The story of the Oregon Trail and the people who used it begins when the trail was an ancient Indian footpath used by explorers and fur traders. Independence, Missouri, was the frontier town that served as the starting place. The trail wound westward, following the banks of the Platte, North Platte, and Snake Rivers. It crossed the Rockies through the South Pass, crossed the Blue Mountains further north, and ended in Oregon Country at a place called The Dalles. From The Dalles, anyone continuing on to the Williamette Valley floated down the Columbia River. Up until the mid-1830s, no wagon had ever made the trip.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It is difficult for us to imagine Oregon Country as it was a century and a half ago. A vast wilderness that stretched from the crest of the Rockies to the Pacific coast, it included the present states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The area was inhabited by several tribes of Indians, including the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Nez Perce. There were some trappers and traders in the region, but to most, the area was too far away and too strange for them to consider settling there.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     President Thomas Jefferson was the first to actively encourage exploration of Oregon Country. After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, he sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark into the area to seek a trade route to the Pacific. Jefferson knew that their explorations would help the United States strengthen its claim to the Pacific Northwest.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It is important to remember that for the first half of the nineteenth century both Great Britain and the United States occupied the Pacific Northwest. Great Britain already had a strong claim to the land that was to become Canada, and the Hudson's Bay Company had many fur trading posts in the Pacific Northwest. There were American fur trading posts as well, such as the American Fur Company organized by John Jacob Astor in 1808.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     In 1818, Great Britain and the United States signed a treaty that allowed both countries to occupy the area, but it was not until the 1830s that Americans began moving in. Missionaries, such as Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, were among the first settlers. When people learned that the Whitmans had journeyed successfully over the Oregon Trail in 1836, they began to think differently about Oregon Country. The fact that a woman had made the journey safely, and that the Whitmans had traveled with a wagon, encouraged others to think that they could make the journey, too.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     In fact, when Dr. Whitman returned East in 1842 to help promote his missionary work, he found many people who were eager to travel to Oregon Country. In 1843, some 1,000 people and 2,000 animals joined Dr. Whitman and a surveyor named Jesse Applegate as they led a wagon train over the Oregon Trail. The ""great migration"" — one of the greatest migrations in recorded history — had begun.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Why were so many people going to Oregon Country? Some said they had Oregon fever, a ""disease"" that made them restless, hungry for new land, and eager for adventure. But why were they going all the way to Oregon Country? One very important reason was that the United States government was encouraging them to do so. Since Thomas Jefferson's presidency, our government had come a long way toward believing that the United States should stretch from coast to coast. If Americans were to settle the Oregon Country in large numbers, our claim to the land would be strengthened.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     One man in particular wrote reports about the Oregon Country that were designed to make people want to go there. His name was John Charles Frémont (1813-90). He was a soldier, explorer and political leader who, in 1838, was asked to be the chief assistant in mapping the upper waters of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. He wrote very detailed descriptions of his explorations, and his reports were reprinted and read by many people. It was Frémont who wrote guidebooks for emigrants who were encouraged to settle in Oregon Country and help wrest it from British control.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     As Americans began pouring into the Williamette River valley in the 1840s, a dispute between Great Britain and the United States almost caused a war. The biggest disagreement was over the northern boundary of the Oregon Country. The British wanted the boundary to be on the north bank of the Columbia River. The Americans wanted it further north on the 54th Parallel. After careful negotiations, war was prevented when the two countries signed the Oregon Treaty of 1846. They agreed to compromise, placing the boundary on the 49th Parallel extending to Puget sound and leaving Vancouver Island as a part of Canada.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The Oregon Treaty gave the United States undisputed claim to the Pacific Northwest, encouraging even more emigrants to move west. By the 1850s, the Oregon Trail had become a series of parallel wagon ruts that could be seen even in solid rock. Oregon Country officially became the Oregon Territory in 1848. In 1859, the state of Oregon was created and admitted to the Union as the 33rd state. Twenty years earlier the area had been an unknown wilderness!</div><div class=""paragraph"">     What was it like to travel on the Oregon Trail in the 1840s and 1850s? Fortunately there are many accounts that have survived, written by the people who used the trail and who wanted to preserve their experiences for later generations. The story of the Sager children was preserved by three of the Sager girls who survived. Diaries, such as the one handed down to Jean Burroughs, provide eyewitness accounts of the daily travel. When we read these accounts, we can easily imagine the hardship, the anxiety, and the excitement the emigrants must have experienced.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     According to several historians, at least 30,000 emigrants died on the Oregon Trail between 1843 and 1859. You might say that there is an average of one grave for every 100 yards of trail from the Missouri River to the Williamette River! Why did so many people die? Cholera, a disease that spreads when there are filthy conditions caused by garbage and sewage, claimed thousands of lives. Emigrants passed through, and sometimes camped near, the refuse left by earlier wagon trains. Other diseases caused people to die, but cholera was probably the most common.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Accident was another common cause of death. Children often hurt themselves as the wagons rolled along. Doctors were not always available, and even when they were they often lacked necessary supplies. Most of the emigrants were simply not prepared for the difficult journey ahead, and they were careless.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     There were some problems as the emigrants passed through Indian territory. Indian attacks usually took the form of raids on the livestock, but few people were ever killed. The Indians owned much of the land on both sides of the Oregon Trail, and the emigrants were trespassing. Some tribal leaders demanded payment as the wagon trains rolled through, and, if the emigrants cooperated, there was no further trouble. In other instances, the Indians made a surprise attack, took livestock, and left the wagons unharmed.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It would be several years later, in the 1860s, when the Indians would finally realize that their homelands had been lost forever. Tribal chiefs, such as Red Cloud and Crazy Horse, both of the Oglala Sioux, devoted their lives to trying to save their homelands and people. But the idea that the United States should stretch from coast to coast had already taken hold. The Oregon Trail, no longer just a footpath, had opened the way to the West.</div><div class=""paragraph"">From Cobblestone's December, 1981, issue: <span class=""stressed_text_2"">The Oregon Trail.</span> © 1981, Cobblestone Publishing Inc., Peterborough, NH 03458.

See what you can land. Every family in our wagon train needs fresh fish for supper."" Nettie Emory's father stood by her on the banks of the North Platte River late one evening in June, 1863. ""And mind you keep your shoes on this time, Pet.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie drew down the corners of her mouth in disappointment. She'd been counting on cool water and squishy mud to cool her feet, hot and sweaty from her high–topped, laced shoes. She knew her father was referring to the time she had wandered from camp to gather ""yellow roses,""the enticing blooms of prickly pear cactus. Stepping on dozens of stickers in her bare feet was a painful experience she would never forget. She'd never seen cactus before so how was she supposed to know?</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Now, holding her line and hook high, Nettie edged closer to the water, hoping against hope she would catch a fish. Otherwise, it was going to be salt bacon and corn pone for supper again. After several weeks on the Oregon Trail, their supply of meat was used up. Even wild game had been scarce, and they had not yet reached the plentiful buffalo on the plains. She was certainly tired of the monotonous diet.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie's father called back over his shoulder. ""Remember there's quicksand and sinkholes. Test the ground before you step. Stay close to me. Good luck, Blackie.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie grinned at her father's use of her nickname, given because of her unusually dark hair and eyes. Her French mother preferred Minette, but had agreed to the shortened form of Nettie. An only child, the nine–year–old girl answered to all the names that her loving parents called her. She was proud that her father had been chosen wagon master to lead the train over the plains and mountains to faraway Oregon. Perhaps if she caught a fish, he'd be proud of her too, just as he was when she drove the ox team safely during her mother's illness. She wanted to help him during this difficult journey as much as she could.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     She watched him and the other men choose places to cast their lines at the water's edge. Some waded into the shallows near the sand islands in the river where the current was running swifter because of a recent rain. Through a thicket of willows she edged closer to where a quiet pool had formed under the tree roots. Just the place for a fish to hide, she thought. She quietly dropped her hook, watching it sink to the bottom. Then she waited, swinging her sun-bonnet strings back and forth to brush off the gnats and mosquitoes that hummed around her face.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     She waited. She waited, but no fish rose to her bait. As she slid down the riverbank she kept her father's black hat in sight. Her line drifted faster with the fresh current. Fishing can be tiresome, she fretted, but it's better than just watching the trail from the back of our crowded wagon.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     None of the men had caught a fish so far. She squinted at the sun, well above the horizon of the summer sky. There's plenty of time before supper fires are lighted, she thought. With her left hand she slapped at a pesky mosquito again; her right hand tightened its grip on the pole. A sudden jerk on the line caused her to stumble forward to keep her balance. A bite! A bite! The pull on her line was steady and strong. She lifted her pole and it bent forward. It surely must be a big one.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     And it was a big one, big enough to pull Nettie dangerously toward the water. Her breath came in gasps. She dug in the heels of her sturdy shoes, glad now that she wasn't barefoot. She couldn't back up because the end of the line was moving fast toward the center of the river. She could no longer see her father's hat because of the tall rushes growing at water's edge.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Grimly, she held on. Her feet were already soaked. Would her next step be into quicksand? The line moved downstream, dragging Nettie into ankle–deep, then knee–deep water. She was excited about the catch and dared not let go. She also was becoming a little frightened.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Papa, Papa, I've got a big one!"" she cried. ""It's pulling me into the river!"" Her voice was lost in the evening breeze that stirred the rushes. ""Papa, can't you hear me?""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     How much longer could she hold on? She used all her strength. Her shoulders ached from the strain. ""Help! Help!"" she shouted to anyone who might hear her. She turned her body so that the line wrapped around her hips. Her legs sank deeper into the sandy bottom. Muddy water billowed out her full skirt. ""I'm like an umbrella,"" she laughed to herself. ""Now maybe they'll see me.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Fresh fish or dry salt bacon: the very thought gave her extra endurance. Not just for her own family, but the other wagon people who were also hungry for a change in diet. Drawing a deeper breath, she called hoarsely, ""Save me! Save my fish!""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     An answering shout gave her courage. She heard footsteps splashing nearer. ""Blackie, hold on. Pull back,"" called her father. Other men dropped their poles and ran to help. Josiah Emory placed his body in front of his little girl's, grabbing the line with his strong hands. Nettie clung to the pole while her father slowly, steadily, pulled in the line. Soon a flashing, grey body flapped in and out of the water. ""It's a big catfish, Blackie, a really huge one. Good girl! I'm proud of you."" Only then did Nettie let go. He lifted the pole with a grunt at the unexpected weight. Indeed, it was a huge fish. Her father guessed it was over three feet long and more than twenty-five pounds.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Sloshing back to the wagon, muddy and exhausted, Nettie wondered what her mother would say. Her dress and petticoats were caked with red mud. Her shoes squished water through the laces. Now perhaps I can go barefoot until my shoes dry, she thought. She hoped her mother would be so glad over the fish that she wouldn't scold.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     News of Nettie's big catch spread among the wagons. A hungry crowd gathered to watch while Nettie's father dressed the fish. ""Build up the fire,"" he said. ""We'll all feast tonight. No ration of salt pork but fresh fish for all.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""And biscuits and syrup instead of corn bread?"" Nettie asked her mother.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Yes, Minette. All the biscuits and syrup and fish you can eat.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie grinned a happy, tired grin. ""I'll always remember how that fish almost swam away with me.

They seem to have always been on the move, searching for a better place to live. From America's first colonies small groups of people uprooted themselves, migrating westward to look for better farmland. They built pioneer roads, or trails, such as the Cumberland Road that led into the Ohio Valley, and the Genesee Road that led across New York to the shores of Lake Erie. Many of these roads and trails have disappeared. Others can still be traced, revealing artifacts along the way that help us to recreate their story.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The Oregon Trail is one of these trails. Even today you can retrace its path, walking beside wagon ruts that were gouged almost a century and a half ago. The Oregon Trail was different from the earlier trails and roads that had crossed the Appalachian Mountains in the East. It was longer and more difficult than most pioneers had experienced. Unlike the eastern trails, the Oregon Trail crossed nearly 2,000 miles of unfamiliar prairie, desert, and mountainous regions. There were no settlements along the way that could offer friendly hospitality, and emigrants couldn't scout out their new homeland before they moved there. Oregon Country was so far away, it took from four to six months to get there. When people moved there, they moved to stay.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The story of the Oregon Trail and the people who used it begins when the trail was an ancient Indian footpath used by explorers and fur traders. Independence, Missouri, was the frontier town that served as the starting place. The trail wound westward, following the banks of the Platte, North Platte, and Snake Rivers. It crossed the Rockies through the South Pass, crossed the Blue Mountains further north, and ended in Oregon Country at a place called The Dalles. From The Dalles, anyone continuing on to the Williamette Valley floated down the Columbia River. Up until the mid-1830s, no wagon had ever made the trip.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It is difficult for us to imagine Oregon Country as it was a century and a half ago. A vast wilderness that stretched from the crest of the Rockies to the Pacific coast, it included the present states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The area was inhabited by several tribes of Indians, including the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Nez Perce. There were some trappers and traders in the region, but to most, the area was too far away and too strange for them to consider settling there.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     President Thomas Jefferson was the first to actively encourage exploration of Oregon Country. After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, he sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark into the area to seek a trade route to the Pacific. Jefferson knew that their explorations would help the United States strengthen its claim to the Pacific Northwest.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It is important to remember that for the first half of the nineteenth century both Great Britain and the United States occupied the Pacific Northwest. Great Britain already had a strong claim to the land that was to become Canada, and the Hudson's Bay Company had many fur trading posts in the Pacific Northwest. There were American fur trading posts as well, such as the American Fur Company organized by John Jacob Astor in 1808.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     In 1818, Great Britain and the United States signed a treaty that allowed both countries to occupy the area, but it was not until the 1830s that Americans began moving in. Missionaries, such as Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, were among the first settlers. When people learned that the Whitmans had journeyed successfully over the Oregon Trail in 1836, they began to think differently about Oregon Country. The fact that a woman had made the journey safely, and that the Whitmans had traveled with a wagon, encouraged others to think that they could make the journey, too.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     In fact, when Dr. Whitman returned East in 1842 to help promote his missionary work, he found many people who were eager to travel to Oregon Country. In 1843, some 1,000 people and 2,000 animals joined Dr. Whitman and a surveyor named Jesse Applegate as they led a wagon train over the Oregon Trail. The ""great migration"" — one of the greatest migrations in recorded history — had begun.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Why were so many people going to Oregon Country? Some said they had Oregon fever, a ""disease"" that made them restless, hungry for new land, and eager for adventure. But why were they going all the way to Oregon Country? One very important reason was that the United States government was encouraging them to do so. Since Thomas Jefferson's presidency, our government had come a long way toward believing that the United States should stretch from coast to coast. If Americans were to settle the Oregon Country in large numbers, our claim to the land would be strengthened.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     One man in particular wrote reports about the Oregon Country that were designed to make people want to go there. His name was John Charles Frémont (1813-90). He was a soldier, explorer and political leader who, in 1838, was asked to be the chief assistant in mapping the upper waters of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. He wrote very detailed descriptions of his explorations, and his reports were reprinted and read by many people. It was Frémont who wrote guidebooks for emigrants who were encouraged to settle in Oregon Country and help wrest it from British control.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     As Americans began pouring into the Williamette River valley in the 1840s, a dispute between Great Britain and the United States almost caused a war. The biggest disagreement was over the northern boundary of the Oregon Country. The British wanted the boundary to be on the north bank of the Columbia River. The Americans wanted it further north on the 54th Parallel. After careful negotiations, war was prevented when the two countries signed the Oregon Treaty of 1846. They agreed to compromise, placing the boundary on the 49th Parallel extending to Puget sound and leaving Vancouver Island as a part of Canada.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The Oregon Treaty gave the United States undisputed claim to the Pacific Northwest, encouraging even more emigrants to move west. By the 1850s, the Oregon Trail had become a series of parallel wagon ruts that could be seen even in solid rock. Oregon Country officially became the Oregon Territory in 1848. In 1859, the state of Oregon was created and admitted to the Union as the 33rd state. Twenty years earlier the area had been an unknown wilderness!</div><div class=""paragraph"">     What was it like to travel on the Oregon Trail in the 1840s and 1850s? Fortunately there are many accounts that have survived, written by the people who used the trail and who wanted to preserve their experiences for later generations.

They seem to have always been on the move, searching for a better place to live. From America's first colonies small groups of people uprooted themselves, migrating westward to look for better farmland. They built pioneer roads, or trails, such as the Cumberland Road that led into the Ohio Valley, and the Genesee Road that led across New York to the shores of Lake Erie. Many of these roads and trails have disappeared. Others can still be traced, revealing artifacts along the way that help us to recreate their story.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The Oregon Trail is one of these trails. Even today you can retrace its path, walking beside wagon ruts that were gouged almost a century and a half ago. The Oregon Trail was different from the earlier trails and roads that had crossed the Appalachian Mountains in the East. It was longer and more difficult than most pioneers had experienced. Unlike the eastern trails, the Oregon Trail crossed nearly 2,000 miles of unfamiliar prairie, desert, and mountainous regions. There were no settlements along the way that could offer friendly hospitality, and emigrants couldn't scout out their new homeland before they moved there. Oregon Country was so far away, it took from four to six months to get there. When people moved there, they moved to stay.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The story of the Oregon Trail and the people who used it begins when the trail was an ancient Indian footpath used by explorers and fur traders. Independence, Missouri, was the frontier town that served as the starting place. The trail wound westward, following the banks of the Platte, North Platte, and Snake Rivers. It crossed the Rockies through the South Pass, crossed the Blue Mountains further north, and ended in Oregon Country at a place called The Dalles. From The Dalles, anyone continuing on to the Williamette Valley floated down the Columbia River. Up until the mid-1830s, no wagon had ever made the trip.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It is difficult for us to imagine Oregon Country as it was a century and a half ago. A vast wilderness that stretched from the crest of the Rockies to the Pacific coast, it included the present states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The area was inhabited by several tribes of Indians, including the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Nez Perce. There were some trappers and traders in the region, but to most, the area was too far away and too strange for them to consider settling there.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     President Thomas Jefferson was the first to actively encourage exploration of Oregon Country. After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, he sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark into the area to seek a trade route to the Pacific. Jefferson knew that their explorations would help the United States strengthen its claim to the Pacific Northwest.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It is important to remember that for the first half of the nineteenth century both Great Britain and the United States occupied the Pacific Northwest. Great Britain already had a strong claim to the land that was to become Canada, and the Hudson's Bay Company had many fur trading posts in the Pacific Northwest. There were American fur trading posts as well, such as the American Fur Company organized by John Jacob Astor in 1808.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     In 1818, Great Britain and the United States signed a treaty that allowed both countries to occupy the area, but it was not until the 1830s that Americans began moving in. Missionaries, such as Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, were among the first settlers. When people learned that the Whitmans had journeyed successfully over the Oregon Trail in 1836, they began to think differently about Oregon Country. The fact that a woman had made the journey safely, and that the Whitmans had traveled with a wagon, encouraged others to think that they could make the journey, too.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     In fact, when Dr. Whitman returned East in 1842 to help promote his missionary work, he found many people who were eager to travel to Oregon Country. In 1843, some 1,000 people and 2,000 animals joined Dr. Whitman and a surveyor named Jesse Applegate as they led a wagon train over the Oregon Trail. The ""great migration"" — one of the greatest migrations in recorded history — had begun.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Why were so many people going to Oregon Country? Some said they had Oregon fever, a ""disease"" that made them restless, hungry for new land, and eager for adventure. But why were they going all the way to Oregon Country? One very important reason was that the United States government was encouraging them to do so. Since Thomas Jefferson's presidency, our government had come a long way toward believing that the United States should stretch from coast to coast. If Americans were to settle the Oregon Country in large numbers, our claim to the land would be strengthened.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     One man in particular wrote reports about the Oregon Country that were designed to make people want to go there. His name was John Charles Frémont (1813-90). He was a soldier, explorer and political leader who, in 1838, was asked to be the chief assistant in mapping the upper waters of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. He wrote very detailed descriptions of his explorations, and his reports were reprinted and read by many people. It was Frémont who wrote guidebooks for emigrants who were encouraged to settle in Oregon Country and help wrest it from British control.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     As Americans began pouring into the Williamette River valley in the 1840s, a dispute between Great Britain and the United States almost caused a war. The biggest disagreement was over the northern boundary of the Oregon Country. The British wanted the boundary to be on the north bank of the Columbia River. The Americans wanted it further north on the 54th Parallel. After careful negotiations, war was prevented when the two countries signed the Oregon Treaty of 1846. They agreed to compromise, placing the boundary on the 49th Parallel extending to Puget sound and leaving Vancouver Island as a part of Canada.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     The Oregon Treaty gave the United States undisputed claim to the Pacific Northwest, encouraging even more emigrants to move west. By the 1850s, the Oregon Trail had become a series of parallel wagon ruts that could be seen even in solid rock. Oregon Country officially became the Oregon Territory in 1848. In 1859, the state of Oregon was created and admitted to the Union as the 33rd state. Twenty years earlier the area had been an unknown wilderness!</div><div class=""paragraph"">     What was it like to travel on the Oregon Trail in the 1840s and 1850s? Fortunately there are many accounts that have survived, written by the people who used the trail and who wanted to preserve their experiences for later generations. The story of the Sager children was preserved by three of the Sager girls who survived. Diaries, such as the one handed down to Jean Burroughs, provide eyewitness accounts of the daily travel. When we read these accounts, we can easily imagine the hardship, the anxiety, and the excitement the emigrants must have experienced.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     According to several historians, at least 30,000 emigrants died on the Oregon Trail between 1843 and 1859. You might say that there is an average of one grave for every 100 yards of trail from the Missouri River to the Williamette River! Why did so many people die? Cholera, a disease that spreads when there are filthy conditions caused by garbage and sewage, claimed thousands of lives. Emigrants passed through, and sometimes camped near, the refuse left by earlier wagon trains. Other diseases caused people to die, but cholera was probably the most common.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Accident was another common cause of death. Children often hurt themselves as the wagons rolled along. Doctors were not always available, and even when they were they often lacked necessary supplies. Most of the emigrants were simply not prepared for the difficult journey ahead, and they were careless.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     There were some problems as the emigrants passed through Indian territory. Indian attacks usually took the form of raids on the livestock, but few people were ever killed. The Indians owned much of the land on both sides of the Oregon Trail, and the emigrants were trespassing. Some tribal leaders demanded payment as the wagon trains rolled through, and, if the emigrants cooperated, there was no further trouble. In other instances, the Indians made a surprise attack, took livestock, and left the wagons unharmed.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     It would be several years later, in the 1860s, when the Indians would finally realize that their homelands had been lost forever. Tribal chiefs, such as Red Cloud and Crazy Horse, both of the Oglala Sioux, devoted their lives to trying to save their homelands and people. But the idea that the United States should stretch from coast to coast had already taken hold. The Oregon Trail, no longer just a footpath, had opened the way to the West.</div><div class=""paragraph"">From Cobblestone's December, 1981, issue: <span class=""stressed_text_2"">The Oregon Trail.</span> © 1981, Cobblestone Publishing Inc., Peterborough, NH 03458.

See what you can land. Every family in our wagon train needs fresh fish for supper."" Nettie Emory's father stood by her on the banks of the North Platte River late one evening in June, 1863. ""And mind you keep your shoes on this time, Pet.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie drew down the corners of her mouth in disappointment. She'd been counting on cool water and squishy mud to cool her feet, hot and sweaty from her high–topped, laced shoes. She knew her father was referring to the time she had wandered from camp to gather ""yellow roses,""the enticing blooms of prickly pear cactus. Stepping on dozens of stickers in her bare feet was a painful experience she would never forget. She'd never seen cactus before so how was she supposed to know?</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Now, holding her line and hook high, Nettie edged closer to the water, hoping against hope she would catch a fish. Otherwise, it was going to be salt bacon and corn pone for supper again. After several weeks on the Oregon Trail, their supply of meat was used up. Even wild game had been scarce, and they had not yet reached the plentiful buffalo on the plains. She was certainly tired of the monotonous diet.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie's father called back over his shoulder. ""Remember there's quicksand and sinkholes. Test the ground before you step. Stay close to me. Good luck, Blackie.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie grinned at her father's use of her nickname, given because of her unusually dark hair and eyes. Her French mother preferred Minette, but had agreed to the shortened form of Nettie. An only child, the nine–year–old girl answered to all the names that her loving parents called her. She was proud that her father had been chosen wagon master to lead the train over the plains and mountains to faraway Oregon. Perhaps if she caught a fish, he'd be proud of her too, just as he was when she drove the ox team safely during her mother's illness. She wanted to help him during this difficult journey as much as she could.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     She watched him and the other men choose places to cast their lines at the water's edge. Some waded into the shallows near the sand islands in the river where the current was running swifter because of a recent rain. Through a thicket of willows she edged closer to where a quiet pool had formed under the tree roots. Just the place for a fish to hide, she thought. She quietly dropped her hook, watching it sink to the bottom. Then she waited, swinging her sun-bonnet strings back and forth to brush off the gnats and mosquitoes that hummed around her face.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     She waited. She waited, but no fish rose to her bait. As she slid down the riverbank she kept her father's black hat in sight. Her line drifted faster with the fresh current. Fishing can be tiresome, she fretted, but it's better than just watching the trail from the back of our crowded wagon.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     None of the men had caught a fish so far. She squinted at the sun, well above the horizon of the summer sky. There's plenty of time before supper fires are lighted, she thought. With her left hand she slapped at a pesky mosquito again; her right hand tightened its grip on the pole. A sudden jerk on the line caused her to stumble forward to keep her balance. A bite! A bite! The pull on her line was steady and strong. She lifted her pole and it bent forward. It surely must be a big one.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     And it was a big one, big enough to pull Nettie dangerously toward the water. Her breath came in gasps. She dug in the heels of her sturdy shoes, glad now that she wasn't barefoot. She couldn't back up because the end of the line was moving fast toward the center of the river. She could no longer see her father's hat because of the tall rushes growing at water's edge.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Grimly, she held on. Her feet were already soaked. Would her next step be into quicksand? The line moved downstream, dragging Nettie into ankle–deep, then knee–deep water. She was excited about the catch and dared not let go. She also was becoming a little frightened.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Papa, Papa, I've got a big one!"" she cried. ""It's pulling me into the river!"" Her voice was lost in the evening breeze that stirred the rushes. ""Papa, can't you hear me?""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     How much longer could she hold on? She used all her strength. Her shoulders ached from the strain. ""Help! Help!"" she shouted to anyone who might hear her. She turned her body so that the line wrapped around her hips. Her legs sank deeper into the sandy bottom. Muddy water billowed out her full skirt. ""I'm like an umbrella,"" she laughed to herself. ""Now maybe they'll see me.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Fresh fish or dry salt bacon: the very thought gave her extra endurance. Not just for her own family, but the other wagon people who were also hungry for a change in diet. Drawing a deeper breath, she called hoarsely, ""Save me! Save my fish!""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     An answering shout gave her courage. She heard footsteps splashing nearer. ""Blackie, hold on. Pull back,"" called her father. Other men dropped their poles and ran to help. Josiah Emory placed his body in front of his little girl's, grabbing the line with his strong hands. Nettie clung to the pole while her father slowly, steadily, pulled in the line. Soon a flashing, grey body flapped in and out of the water. ""It's a big catfish, Blackie, a really huge one. Good girl! I'm proud of you."" Only then did Nettie let go. He lifted the pole with a grunt at the unexpected weight. Indeed, it was a huge fish. Her father guessed it was over three feet long and more than twenty-five pounds.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Sloshing back to the wagon, muddy and exhausted, Nettie wondered what her mother would say. Her dress and petticoats were caked with red mud. Her shoes squished water through the laces. Now perhaps I can go barefoot until my shoes dry, she thought. She hoped her mother would be so glad over the fish that she wouldn't scold.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     News of Nettie's big catch spread among the wagons. A hungry crowd gathered to watch while Nettie's father dressed the fish. ""Build up the fire,"" he said. ""We'll all feast tonight. No ration of salt pork but fresh fish for all.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""And biscuits and syrup instead of corn bread?"" Nettie asked her mother.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Yes, Minette. All the biscuits and syrup and fish you can eat.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie grinned a happy, tired grin. ""I'll always remember how that fish almost swam away with me. I am going to write about it in my diary.""</div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">A Note from the Author:</span></div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_2"">     This is a true story.

Through a thicket of willows she edged closer to where a quiet pool had formed under the tree roots. Just the place for a fish to hide, she thought. She quietly dropped her hook, watching it sink to the bottom. Then she waited, swinging her sun-bonnet strings back and forth to brush off the gnats and mosquitoes that hummed around her face.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     She waited. She waited, but no fish rose to her bait. As she slid down the riverbank she kept her father's black hat in sight. Her line drifted faster with the fresh current. Fishing can be tiresome, she fretted, but it's better than just watching the trail from the back of our crowded wagon.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     None of the men had caught a fish so far. She squinted at the sun, well above the horizon of the summer sky. There's plenty of time before supper fires are lighted, she thought. With her left hand she slapped at a pesky mosquito again; her right hand tightened its grip on the pole. A sudden jerk on the line caused her to stumble forward to keep her balance. A bite! A bite! The pull on her line was steady and strong. She lifted her pole and it bent forward. It surely must be a big one.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     And it was a big one, big enough to pull Nettie dangerously toward the water. Her breath came in gasps. She dug in the heels of her sturdy shoes, glad now that she wasn't barefoot. She couldn't back up because the end of the line was moving fast toward the center of the river. She could no longer see her father's hat because of the tall rushes growing at water's edge.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Grimly, she held on. Her feet were already soaked. Would her next step be into quicksand? The line moved downstream, dragging Nettie into ankle–deep, then knee–deep water. She was excited about the catch and dared not let go. She also was becoming a little frightened.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Papa, Papa, I've got a big one!"" she cried. ""It's pulling me into the river!"" Her voice was lost in the evening breeze that stirred the rushes. ""Papa, can't you hear me?""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     How much longer could she hold on? She used all her strength. Her shoulders ached from the strain. ""Help! Help!"" she shouted to anyone who might hear her. She turned her body so that the line wrapped around her hips. Her legs sank deeper into the sandy bottom. Muddy water billowed out her full skirt. ""I'm like an umbrella,"" she laughed to herself. ""Now maybe they'll see me.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Fresh fish or dry salt bacon: the very thought gave her extra endurance. Not just for her own family, but the other wagon people who were also hungry for a change in diet. Drawing a deeper breath, she called hoarsely, ""Save me! Save my fish!""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     An answering shout gave her courage. She heard footsteps splashing nearer. ""Blackie, hold on. Pull back,"" called her father. Other men dropped their poles and ran to help. Josiah Emory placed his body in front of his little girl's, grabbing the line with his strong hands. Nettie clung to the pole while her father slowly, steadily, pulled in the line. Soon a flashing, grey body flapped in and out of the water. ""It's a big catfish, Blackie, a really huge one. Good girl! I'm proud of you."" Only then did Nettie let go. He lifted the pole with a grunt at the unexpected weight. Indeed, it was a huge fish. Her father guessed it was over three feet long and more than twenty-five pounds.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Sloshing back to the wagon, muddy and exhausted, Nettie wondered what her mother would say. Her dress and petticoats were caked with red mud. Her shoes squished water through the laces. Now perhaps I can go barefoot until my shoes dry, she thought. She hoped her mother would be so glad over the fish that she wouldn't scold.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     News of Nettie's big catch spread among the wagons. A hungry crowd gathered to watch while Nettie's father dressed the fish. ""Build up the fire,"" he said. ""We'll all feast tonight. No ration of salt pork but fresh fish for all.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""And biscuits and syrup instead of corn bread?"" Nettie asked her mother.</div><div class=""paragraph"">     ""Yes, Minette. All the biscuits and syrup and fish you can eat.""</div><div class=""paragraph"">     Nettie grinned a happy, tired grin. ""I'll always remember how that fish almost swam away with me. I am going to write about it in my diary.""</div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">A Note from the Author:</span></div><div class=""paragraph""><span class=""stressed_text_2"">     This is a true story.

They cooked their first suppers in the field that night at nine o'clock, and wrapped themselves in their blankets, to be awakened by the roar of battle, and receive, thus early, their bloody baptism. Before they had been on the field one day, their magnificent corps was decimated, most of the officers killed.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      On going to the field the second day, our regiment strode on in line over wounded, dying, and dead. My office detaching me from the lines, I had an opportunity to notice incidents about the field. The regiment halted amidst a gory, ghastly scene. I heard a voice calling, ""Ho, friend! ho! Come here."" I went to a pile of dead human forms in every kind of stiff contortion; I saw one arm raised, beckoning me. I found there a rebel, covered with blood, pillowing his head on the dead body of a comrade. Both were red from head to foot. The live one had lain across the dead one all that horrible, long night in the storm. The first thing he said to me was ""Give me some water. Send me a surgeon—won't you! What made you come down here to fight us? We never would have come up there."" And then he affectionately put one arm over the form, and laid his bloody face against the cold, clammy, bloody face of his friend.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      I filled his canteen nearly—reserving some for myself—knowing that I might be in the same sad condition. I told him we had no surgeon in our regiment, and that we would have to suffer, if wounded, the same as he; that other regiments were coming, and to call on them for surgeon; that they were humane.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      ""Forward!"" shouted the Colonel; and 'Forward' was repeated by the officers. I left him.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      The above recalls to mind one of the hardest principles in warfare—where your sympathy and humanity are appealed to, and from sense of expediency, you are forbidden to exercise it. After our regiment had been nearly annihilated, and were compelled to retreat under a galling fire, a boy was supporting his dying brother on one arm, and trying to drag him from the field and the advancing foe. He looked at me imploringly, and said, ""Captain, help him—won't you? Do, Captain; he'll live."" I said, ""He's shot through the head; don't you see? and can't live—he's dying now."" ""Oh, no, he ain't, Captain. Don't leave me."" I was forced to reply, ""The rebels won't hurt him. Lay him down and come, or both you and I will be lost.""The rush of bullets and the yells of the approaching enemy hurried me away—leaving the young soldier over his dying brother.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      At home I used to wince at the sight of a wound or of a corpse; but here, in one day, I learned to be among the scenes I am describing without emotion. My friend and myself, on the second night, looking in the dark for a place to lie down, he said, ""Let's lie down here. Here's some fellows sleeping.""We slept in quiet until dawn revealed that we had passed the night among sprawling, stiffened, ghastly corpses. I saw one of our dead soldiers with his mouth crammed full of cartridges until the cheeks were bulged out. Several protruded from his mouth. This was done by the rebels. On the third day most of our time was employed in burying the dead. Shallow pits were dug, which would soon fill with water. Into these we threw our comrades with a heavy splash, or a dump against solid bottom. Many a hopeful, promising youth thus indecently ended his career.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      I stood in one place in the woods near the spot of the engagement of the 57th Illinois, and counted eighty-one dead rebels. There I saw one tree, seven inches in diameter, with thirty-one bullet holes. Such had been death's storm. Near the scenes of the last of the fighting, where the rebels precipitately retreated, I saw one grave containing one hundred and thirty-seven dead rebels, and one side of it another grave containing forty-one dead Federals.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      One dead and uniformed officer lay covered with a little housing of rails. On it was a fly-leaf of a memorandum-book with the pencil writing: 'Federals, respect my father's corpse.' Many of our boys wanted to cut off his buttons and gold cord; but our Colonel had the body religiously guarded.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      My poor friend, Carson, after having fought and worked, and slaved from the beginning of the war, unrequited, comparatively, and after having passed hundreds of hair-breadth escapes, and through this wild battle was killed with almost the last shot. A round shot took off his whole face and tore part of his head. Poor Carson! We all remember your patriotism, your courage, your devotion. We will cheer, all we can, the bereaved and dear ones you have left.</div><div class=""paragraph""></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""font-size:7.5pt"">""Battle of Shiloh"" from <span class=""stressed_text_2"">Civil War Eyewitness Reports,</span> ed. by H.E.

The first great battle of the war had been fought at Bull Run (Manassas) in Virginia in July 1861, nearly a year before. It had ended in a temporary stalemate in the eastern theater. In the West, Kentucky tried to remain neutral, but by the end of 1861, both sides had sent troops into the state.</img></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      In February 1862, Union General Ulysses S. Grant captured forts Henry and Donelson on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in northern Tennessee near the Kentucky boundary, taking about 11,500 men and 40 guns. The whole Confederate line of defense across Kentucky gave way. The Confederates were forced to retreat to Murfreesboro, Tenn., southeast of Nashville, as other Union forces moved toward Nashville.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      With the Southern press clamoring for his removal, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, commanding the Confederate forces in the region, began to assemble the scattered troops. He decided to designate Corinth, in the northeast corner of Mississippi, as the concentration point for the army.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Assembling of the Armies.</span> By the end of March, Johnston and his second-in-command, Gen. Pierre G.T. Beauregard, managed to gather in Corinth more than 40,000 men, including a few units from as far away as the Gulf of Mexico. These were organized into three corps, commanded by Gens. Leonidas Polk, Braxton Bragg, and William J. Hardee. There was also a small reserve corps under Gen. John C. Breckinridge.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Meanwhile, Gen. Henry W. Halleck, who was Grant's department commander, had ordered Grant's troops to make a reconnaissance southward along the Tennessee River. They encamped near Pittsburg Landing, on the west side of the river, about 5 miles (8 km) north of the Mississippi boundary. There they awaited the arrival of another large Union force under Gen. Don Carlos Buell, which had been ordered southward from Nashville to join them.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Grant's army of 42,000 men was divided into six divisions. Five of these, a total of 37,000, were near Pittsburg Landing. One division, under Gen. Lew Wallace's command, was stationed 6 miles (9 km) to the north. Buell's army marching from Nashville was almost as large as Grant's; together they would far outnumber the concentration of forces that the Confederates could put in the field.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      General Johnston saw that he must strike Grant's army before Buell arrived. The Confederates started northward from Corinth on the afternoon of April 3, intending to attack at dawn on the 5th, but a violent rainstorm turned the dirt roads into a sea of mud. The attack was postponed from the 5th to Sunday, April 6, but on the 5th the leading division of Buell's army arrived on the other side of the Tennessee River, only 7 miles (11 km) away.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-align:center""><img align=""middle"" alt=""The Battle of Shiloh Map Image"" height=""594"" src=""./ReadHard_files/ItemResource(13)"" title=""The Battle of Shiloh Map Image"" width=""400""/></div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      That night the armies encamped only 2 miles (3 km) apart, with the Union forces, whose advanced units were about 4 miles (6 km) away up the river, wholly unaware of their danger. Neither they nor their leaders expected an attack. They were not disposed for defense, nor had any trenches been dug for their protection. Early in the morning of April 6, a suspicious brigade commander in Gen. Benjamin M. Prentiss' Union division sent a small force forward to investigate the nearby woods. At dawn they exchanged shots with the Confederates, but it was too late to give warning of the attack, which burst on the Union camps.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Confederate Attack.</span> For the assault, General Johnston had chosen an unusual formation. He formed his troops in three lines, with Hardee's corps in front, Bragg's corps in a second parallel line, and then Polk's and Breckenridge's reserve corps.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      The Confederates charged straight to their front into the divisions of Prestiss and Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, who held the right flank near the Old Shiloh Church. They and Gen. John A. McClernand's division made a brief stand. Many men fought valiantly, but others broke and fled. When Grant who had been absent from the field, arrived he found all five of the divisions fighting desperately in what seemed like a hopeless struggle. He had already sent for Buell's troops, and now he sent for Lew Wallace to join him.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      The Union forces had retreated about halfway to the river to a new position, naturally strong, with open fields on each side and a sunken road in front. Here, in the center, in a position known to history as ""The Hornets' Nest"", the Confederates were halted for hours. They could not take it by assault, but gradually the Union troops on each flank were forced back. Johnston fell mortally wounded. Beauregard took command, and the attack continued.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      Finally ""The Hornets' Nest""was surrounded. Gen. William H.L. Wallace was killed trying to lead his division out. Prentiss was forced to surrender his division, but time was running out for the Confederates. They made a last attack on the Union left toward Pittsburg Landing to cut off the escape of the Union forces, but Buell's troops were now arriving.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px""><span class=""stressed_text_1"">Union Counterstroke.</span> On the next day, Grant attacked. Of the soldiers who had fought on the first day, he had only about 7,000 effectives, (soldiers ready for battle), but Lew Wallace had arrived with his 5,000 and Buell had supplied 20,000 more. To oppose these, the Confederates could muster only about 20,000 men. For hours they held the line in front of Shiloh Church, but at last they withdrew in good order from the field.</div><div class=""paragraph"" style=""text-indent:15px"">      The Battle of Shiloh, second great battle of the war, was a tremendous shock to the people of the North and the South. When the reports were published, they found that each side had lost about 25% of the troops engaged—the Confederates about 10,700, the Union more than 13,000.
